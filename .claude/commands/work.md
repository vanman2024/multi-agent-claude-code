# Work - Intelligent Implementation Command

## Context
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Sprint issues: !`gh issue list --label "sprint:current" --state open --json number,title,labels`
- Blocked issues: !`gh issue list --label "blocked" --state open --json number,title`
- In progress: !`gh issue list --label "status:in-progress" --state open --json number,title,assignees`

## Your Task

When user runs `/work $ARGUMENTS`, intelligently select and implement work.

### Step 0: ðŸ”´ ENFORCE WORKFLOW - MUST BE ON MAIN WITH LATEST

**CRITICAL: Before doing ANYTHING else, check branch and sync status:**

Use the Bash tool to verify you're on main with latest changes:
- Check current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- If not on main, STOP and tell user to: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
- Fetch and compare: !`git fetch origin main && git rev-parse main` vs !`git rev-parse origin/main`
- If behind, auto-pull: !`git pull origin main`

**DO NOT PROCEED if not on main with latest changes!**

### Step 1: Determine Work Mode

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine action:
- If `#123` provided â†’ work on that specific issue
- If `--deploy` â†’ deploy current branch to Vercel
- If `--test` â†’ run test suite
- If no arguments â†’ intelligently select next work item

### Step 2: Intelligent Work Selection (when no issue specified)

#### Check Current Sprint
Use mcp__github__list_issues with label filter "sprint:current" to find sprint work.

#### Check Project Board Status
Use mcp__github__list_issues with label "status:in-progress" to check if work is already active.
If something is in progress, suggest continuing it rather than starting new work.

#### Analyze Dependencies and Blockers
For each potential issue:
1. Use mcp__github__get_issue to get full details
2. Check for "blocked" label
3. Parse body for "Depends on #XX" patterns
4. For each dependency, check if it's closed using mcp__github__get_issue
5. Prioritize issues that unblock the most other work

#### Priority Rules for Selection
1. **Unblocked work that unblocks others** - Issues that when completed, unblock other issues
2. **High priority unblocked issues** - Check for P0, P1, P2 labels
3. **Small quick wins** - Issues labeled "good first issue" or "size:XS"
4. **Continue in-progress work** - If user has work in progress, suggest continuing it
5. **Next in sprint sequence** - Follow logical order if issues are numbered sequentially

### Step 3: Verify Selection Is Valid

Before starting work, use mcp__github__get_issue to verify:
- No "blocked" label
- All dependencies (if any) are closed
- Not already assigned to someone else

### Step 4: Get Complete Issue Context

Use mcp__github__get_issue to retrieve:
- Title and full description
- All labels (type, priority, size, complexity)
- Current state and assignees
- Implementation checklist from body
- Comments for additional context

### Step 5: Create GitHub-Linked Branch

**CRITICAL: Use gh issue develop to create branch on GitHub first:**
!`gh issue develop $ISSUE_NUMBER --checkout`

This command:
- Creates the branch ON GitHub first (properly linked to issue)
- Checks it out locally
- Shows up in the issue's Development section
- Ensures proper GitHub tracking

Get the created branch name:
!`git branch --show-current`

**Important:** The branch name will be something like `123-feature-description` based on the issue.

### Step 6: Optional Worktree Support (if parallel work needed)

**Only if user needs to work on multiple issues simultaneously:**

Check if worktrees are needed:
- Check existing worktrees: !`git worktree list`
- If already working on another issue, offer worktree option

**If parallel work is needed:**
Ask user: "You're working on issue #[OTHER_ISSUE]. Would you like to:
1. Create a worktree for issue #[ISSUE_NUMBER] (work on both)
2. Switch branches (pause current work)
3. Cancel

Choose (1/2/3):"

**If user chooses worktree (option 1):**
- Get current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Create worktree path: `../worktrees/issue-$ISSUE_NUMBER`
- Create worktree: !`git worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" "$BRANCH_NAME"`
- Inform user: "Created worktree at $WORKTREE_PATH"
- Instruct: "Run: cd $WORKTREE_PATH to continue work there"

**Note:** Worktrees are secondary - branch creation via `gh issue develop` is primary!

### Step 7: Configure Git for Issue Tracking (NEW)

**CRITICAL: Set up automatic issue references in commits**

Set up git commit template for this branch:
- Extract issue number: !`echo $BRANCH_NAME | grep -oP '^\d+'`
- Create template: !`echo -e "\n\nRelated to #$ISSUE_NUMBER" > .gitmessage`
- Set template: !`git config commit.template .gitmessage`

Remind user that ALL commits must reference the issue for GitHub timeline tracking.

### Step 8: Implementation Routing

Based on issue labels (complexity and size):

#### For Simple Issues (Complexity 1-2, Size XS-S)
- Implement directly using Read/Write/Edit tools
- Follow the issue's implementation checklist
- Create straightforward solution

#### For Complex Issues (Complexity 3+, Size M+)
Use Task tool with appropriate agent:
- **Features/Bugs** â†’ general-purpose agent
- **Refactoring** â†’ code-refactorer agent  
- **Security** â†’ security-auth-compliance agent
- **Integration** â†’ integration-architect agent

### Step 9: Update Issue Status

Use mcp__github APIs:
1. Add "status:in-progress" label: `mcp__github__update_issue`
2. Add starting work comment: `mcp__github__add_issue_comment`

### Step 10: Work Through Issue Checkboxes

**CRITICAL: Focus on completing issue checkboxes, NOT creating PRs**

1. Parse issue body to extract checkboxes
2. Work through each checkbox systematically
3. Update issue with progress as you complete items
4. Use TodoWrite tool to track local progress

**DO NOT manually create a PR - automation will handle it when checkboxes are complete**

### Step 11: Ensure All Commits Reference the Issue

**For EVERY commit made during work:**

Example commit formats:
- Feature: `feat: Add new feature\n\nRelated to #$ISSUE_NUMBER`
- Bug fix: `fix: Update validation logic #$ISSUE_NUMBER`  
- Documentation: `docs: Update README\n\nPart of #$ISSUE_NUMBER`

**NEVER use "Closes #XX" except in the final PR description**

### Step 12: Run Tests and Validation

Before marking work complete:
!`npm test` or !`pytest` depending on project
!`npm run lint` or appropriate linter
!`npm run typecheck` if TypeScript project

### Step 13: Let Automation Create the PR

**When all checkboxes are complete:**
1. Push your branch: !`git push -u origin $BRANCH_NAME`
2. The automation workflow will detect completed checkboxes
3. It will automatically create the PR with proper "Closes #XX" link
4. PR will transition from draft to ready automatically

**DO NOT manually create PRs with gh pr create**

### Step 14: Clean Up After Merge

When PR is merged (by automation or manually):
1. Checkout main: !`git checkout main`
2. Pull latest: !`git pull origin main`
3. Delete local branch: !`git branch -d $BRANCH_NAME`
4. If using worktree, remove it: !`git worktree remove ../worktrees/issue-$ISSUE_NUMBER-*`

### Step 15: Update Dependencies

Check if this unblocks other issues:
- Use mcp__github__list_issues with label "blocked"
- For each, check if it depended on the completed issue
- Remove "blocked" label if unblocked using mcp__github__update_issue

## Special Actions

### Deploy (--deploy)
!`vercel --prod`

### Test (--test)
!`npm test` or !`pytest` or appropriate test command

## Examples

**Examples:**

- Intelligent auto-selection: `/work` â†’ Finds issue #35 that unblocks 3 others
- Work on specific issue: `/work #42`
- Deploy current work: `/work --deploy` 
- Run tests: `/work --test`

## Key Improvements in This Version

1. **Worktree Support** - Automatically creates worktrees for parallel development
2. **Issue Reference Enforcement** - Every commit references the issue for timeline tracking
3. **No Manual PR Creation** - Automation handles PR when checkboxes complete
4. **Template Compliance** - Uses `!` syntax, no bash code blocks
5. **MCP Function Usage** - Proper use of mcp__github functions instead of complex bash
6. **Checkbox-First Workflow** - Focus on issue completion, not PR management

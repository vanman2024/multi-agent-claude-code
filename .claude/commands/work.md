# Work - Intelligent Implementation Command

## Context
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Sprint issues: !`gh issue list --label "sprint:current" --state open --json number,title,labels`
- Blocked issues: !`gh issue list --label "blocked" --state open --json number,title`
- In progress: !`gh issue list --label "status:in-progress" --state open --json number,title,assignees`

## Your Task

When user runs `/work $ARGUMENTS`, intelligently select and implement work.

### Step 0: ðŸ”´ ENFORCE WORKFLOW - MUST BE ON MAIN WITH LATEST

**CRITICAL: Before doing ANYTHING else, check branch and sync status:**

Use the Bash tool to verify you're on main with latest changes:
- Check current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- If not on main, STOP and tell user to: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
- Fetch and compare: !`git fetch origin main && git rev-parse main` vs !`git rev-parse origin/main`
- If behind, auto-pull: !`git pull origin main`

**DO NOT PROCEED if not on main with latest changes!**

### Step 1: Determine Work Mode

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine action:
- If `#123` provided â†’ work on that specific issue
- If `--deploy` â†’ deploy current branch to Vercel
- If `--test` â†’ run test suite
- If no arguments â†’ intelligently select next work item

### Step 2: Intelligent Work Selection (when no issue specified)

#### Check Current Sprint
Use mcp__github__list_issues with label filter "sprint:current" to find sprint work.

#### Check Project Board Status
Use mcp__github__list_issues with label "status:in-progress" to check if work is already active.
If something is in progress, suggest continuing it rather than starting new work.

#### Analyze Dependencies and Blockers
For each potential issue:
1. Use mcp__github__get_issue to get full details
2. Check for "blocked" label
3. Parse body for "Depends on #XX" patterns
4. For each dependency, check if it's closed using mcp__github__get_issue
5. Prioritize issues that unblock the most other work

#### Priority Rules for Selection
1. **Unblocked work that unblocks others** - Issues that when completed, unblock other issues
2. **High priority unblocked issues** - Check for P0, P1, P2 labels
3. **Small quick wins** - Issues labeled "good first issue" or "size:XS"
4. **Continue in-progress work** - If user has work in progress, suggest continuing it
5. **Next in sprint sequence** - Follow logical order if issues are numbered sequentially

### Step 3: Verify Selection Is Valid

Before starting work, use mcp__github__get_issue to verify:
- No "blocked" label
- All dependencies (if any) are closed
- Not already assigned to someone else

### Step 4: Get Complete Issue Context

Use mcp__github__get_issue to retrieve:
- Title and full description
- All labels (type, priority, size, complexity)
- Current state and assignees
- Implementation checklist from body
- Comments for additional context

### Step 5: Create GitHub-Linked Branch

**CRITICAL: Use gh issue develop to create branch on GitHub first:**
!`gh issue develop $ISSUE_NUMBER --checkout`

This command:
- Creates the branch ON GitHub first (properly linked to issue)
- Checks it out locally
- Shows up in the issue's Development section
- Ensures proper GitHub tracking

Get the created branch name:
!`git branch --show-current`

**Important:** The branch name will be something like `123-feature-description` based on the issue.

### Step 6: Optional Worktree Support (if parallel work needed)

**Only if user needs to work on multiple issues simultaneously:**

Check if worktrees are needed:
- Check existing worktrees: !`git worktree list`
- If already working on another issue, offer worktree option

**If parallel work is needed:**
Ask user: "You're working on issue #[OTHER_ISSUE]. Would you like to:
1. Create a worktree for issue #[ISSUE_NUMBER] (work on both)
2. Switch branches (pause current work)
3. Cancel

Choose (1/2/3):"

**If user chooses worktree (option 1):**
- Get current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Create worktree path: `../worktrees/issue-$ISSUE_NUMBER`
- Create worktree: !`git worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" "$BRANCH_NAME"`
- Inform user: "Created worktree at $WORKTREE_PATH"
- Instruct: "Run: cd $WORKTREE_PATH to continue work there"

**Note:** Worktrees are secondary - branch creation via `gh issue develop` is primary!

### Step 7: Configure Git for Issue Tracking (NEW)

**CRITICAL: Set up automatic issue references in commits**

Set up git commit template for this branch:
- Extract issue number: !`echo $BRANCH_NAME | grep -oP '^\d+'`
- Create template: !`echo -e "\n\nRelated to #$ISSUE_NUMBER" > .gitmessage`
- Set template: !`git config commit.template .gitmessage`

Remind user that ALL commits must reference the issue for GitHub timeline tracking.

### Step 8: Implementation Routing

Based on issue labels (complexity and size):

#### For Simple Issues (Complexity 1-2, Size XS-S)
- Implement directly using Read/Write/Edit tools
- Follow the issue's implementation checklist
- Create straightforward solution

#### For Complex Issues (Complexity 3+, Size M+)
Use Task tool with appropriate agent:
- **Features/Bugs** â†’ general-purpose agent
- **Refactoring** â†’ code-refactorer agent  
- **Security** â†’ security-auth-compliance agent
- **Integration** â†’ integration-architect agent

### Step 9: Update Issue Status

Use mcp__github APIs:
1. Add "status:in-progress" label: `mcp__github__update_issue`
2. Add starting work comment: `mcp__github__add_issue_comment`

### Step 10: Work Through Issue Checkboxes - REAL-TIME MANAGEMENT

**CRITICAL: Actually parse, execute, and update checkboxes in GitHub**

#### A. Parse Issue Checkboxes
Use mcp__github__get_issue to get the full issue body, then extract checkboxes:
- Find all `- [ ]` (unchecked) and `- [x]` (checked) patterns
- Create TodoWrite list mirroring the GitHub checkboxes
- Track which checkboxes are already complete vs. pending

#### B. Systematic Checkbox Execution
For each unchecked checkbox:

1. **Parse the checkbox text** to understand what needs to be done
2. **Determine implementation approach**:
   - Code changes â†’ Use Read/Write/Edit tools
   - Testing â†’ Run appropriate test commands
   - Documentation â†’ Update relevant files
   - Configuration â†’ Modify config files

3. **Execute the checkbox task** using appropriate tools

4. **Trigger automatic checkbox updates via commit**:
   - Include checkbox completion markers in commit messages
   - Use patterns: "âœ… Completed: [checkbox text]" or "feat: [work] âœ… [checkbox]"
   - Automation hook detects patterns and updates GitHub checkboxes
   - Progress comments added automatically by the hook

5. **Mark local TodoWrite as completed**

#### C. Automated Checkbox Update Pattern
For each completed checkbox:
```
# Example checkbox: "- [ ] Add user authentication endpoints"

1. Complete the implementation (add auth endpoints)
2. Commit with completion marker:
   "feat: Add user authentication API endpoints âœ… Add user authentication endpoints"
3. Automation hook detects pattern and updates GitHub:
   - Changes: "- [ ] Add user..." â†’ "- [x] Add user..."
   - Adds comment: "ðŸ¤– Auto-updated 1 checkbox from commit abc1234"
4. Mark TodoWrite item complete
```

#### D. Automated Progress Updates
After each commit with checkbox completion markers:
- Hook automatically updates GitHub checkboxes immediately
- Hook adds progress comment: "ðŸ¤– Auto-updated 1 checkbox from commit [sha]"
- Existing issue-checklist-enforcer.yml provides overall progress: "ðŸ“Š Issue Progress: 3/7 tasks (43%)"
- User sees live progress updates without manual intervention
- Creates automated conversation between commits and GitHub

**DO NOT manually create a PR - automation will handle it when ALL checkboxes are complete**

### Step 11: Ensure All Commits Reference the Issue

**For EVERY commit made during work:**

Example commit formats:
- Feature: `feat: Add new feature\n\nRelated to #$ISSUE_NUMBER`
- Bug fix: `fix: Update validation logic #$ISSUE_NUMBER`  
- Documentation: `docs: Update README\n\nPart of #$ISSUE_NUMBER`

**NEVER use "Closes #XX" except in the final PR description**

### Step 12: Run Tests and Validation

Before marking work complete:
!`npm test` or !`pytest` depending on project
!`npm run lint` or appropriate linter
!`npm run typecheck` if TypeScript project

### Step 13: Let Automation Create the PR

**When all checkboxes are complete:**
1. Push your branch: !`git push -u origin $BRANCH_NAME`
2. The automation workflow will detect completed checkboxes
3. It will automatically create the PR with proper "Closes #XX" link
4. PR will transition from draft to ready automatically

**DO NOT manually create PRs with gh pr create**

### Step 14: Clean Up After Merge

When PR is merged (by automation or manually):
1. Checkout main: !`git checkout main`
2. Pull latest: !`git pull origin main`
3. Delete local branch: !`git branch -d $BRANCH_NAME`
4. If using worktree, remove it: !`git worktree remove ../worktrees/issue-$ISSUE_NUMBER-*`

### Step 15: Update Dependencies

Check if this unblocks other issues:
- Use mcp__github__list_issues with label "blocked"
- For each, check if it depended on the completed issue
- Remove "blocked" label if unblocked using mcp__github__update_issue

## Special Actions

### Deploy (--deploy)
!`vercel --prod`

### Test (--test)
!`npm test` or !`pytest` or appropriate test command

## Examples

**Examples:**

- Intelligent auto-selection: `/work` â†’ Finds issue #35 that unblocks 3 others
- Work on specific issue: `/work #42`
- Deploy current work: `/work --deploy` 
- Run tests: `/work --test`

## Real-Time Checkbox Implementation Example

**Issue #42 has checkboxes:**
```
- [ ] Add user authentication API endpoint
- [ ] Create login form component
- [ ] Add password validation
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Update documentation
```

**When `/work #42` runs:**

1. **Parse checkboxes**: Creates 5 TodoWrite items matching GitHub
2. **Execute first checkbox**: "Add user authentication API endpoint"
   - Implements auth endpoint code
   - Commits: `"feat: Add auth API endpoint âœ… Add user authentication API endpoint"`
   - Hook auto-updates: `- [ ] Add user...` â†’ `- [x] Add user...`
   - Hook comments: "ðŸ¤– Auto-updated 1 checkbox from commit abc1234"
   - Progress tracker shows: "ðŸ“Š Issue Progress: 1/5 tasks (20%)"

3. **Execute second checkbox**: "Create login form component"
   - Implements login form
   - Commits: `"feat: Create login form âœ… Create login form component"`
   - Hook auto-updates: `- [ ] Create login...` â†’ `- [x] Create login...`
   - Hook comments: "ðŸ¤– Auto-updated 1 checkbox from commit def5678"
   - Progress tracker shows: "ðŸ“Š Issue Progress: 2/5 tasks (40%)"

4. **Continues systematically** until all 5 checkboxes complete
5. **Final state**: Issue body shows all `- [x]` checked, timeline shows progress
6. **Automation triggers**: Creates PR when all checkboxes complete

**Result**: User sees automated updates in GitHub issue, progress tracked automatically via commit hooks

## Key Improvements in This Version

1. **Automated Checkbox Management** - Parses checkboxes, executes work, updates via commit hooks
2. **Worktree Support** - Automatically creates worktrees for parallel development
3. **Issue Reference Enforcement** - Every commit references the issue for timeline tracking
4. **No Manual PR Creation** - Automation handles PR when checkboxes complete
5. **Template Compliance** - Uses `!` syntax, no bash code blocks
6. **MCP Function Usage** - Proper use of mcp__github functions instead of complex bash
7. **Checkbox-First Workflow** - Focus on issue completion, not PR management
8. **Automated GitHub Integration** - Commit hooks create automated conversation with GitHub

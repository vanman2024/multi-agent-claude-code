# Create Idea

## Context
- Idea template: @/home/gotime2022/Projects/multi-agent-claude-code/templates/discussions/idea-template.md
- Repository constants:
  - Repo ID: R_kgDOPiMFvA
  - Ideas Category ID: DIC_kwDOPiMFvM4Cui7U

## Important: Context Preservation
If the user references "what we discussed" or "that idea about X":
1. Ask ONE clarifying question to confirm understanding
2. Summarize what you think they mean
3. Then proceed with the decision question (Issue/Discussion/Skip)

## Your Task

When user runs `/create-idea $ARGUMENTS`, follow these exact steps:

### Step 1: Parse Input and Determine Type
Extract the idea summary from $ARGUMENTS
- If empty, ask user for a summary
- If too vague (less than 10 words), ask for more details

**CRITICAL: Ask the user what this should become:**
```
Based on what you've described, what should this become?

1. üìù Issue - Ready to implement now (clear requirements)
2. üí≠ Discussion - Needs exploration first (open questions)
3. ‚ùå Skip - Not worth tracking

Please enter 1, 2, or 3:
```

- If user chooses 1 (Issue): Stop here and suggest using `/create-issue` command instead
- If user chooses 2 (Discussion): Continue with Step 2
- If user chooses 3 (Skip): Exit with "Idea not tracked"

### Step 2: Load and Fill Template
1. READ file: @/home/gotime2022/Projects/multi-agent-claude-code/templates/discussions/idea-template.md
2. Fill template sections based on the summary:
   - **Title**: Extract a concise title from the summary (5-10 words)
   - **Context**: Expand summary into 2-3 sentences explaining why this matters
   - **Current State**: Identify 3 limitations or issues being addressed
   - **Proposed Solution**: Articulate the idea clearly in 2-3 sentences
   - **Benefits**: List 3 concrete improvements (efficiency, quality, DX)
   - **Complexity**: Assess based on scope (Low/Medium/High)
   - **Effort**: Estimate time (Days/Weeks/Months)
   - **Priority**: Determine urgency (Now/Soon/Later)
   - **Questions**: Generate 3 relevant questions to explore
   - **Next Steps**: Create 4 actionable checkbox items
   - **Resources**: Add placeholder for related issues/docs
   - **Category**: Identify from content (Workflow/Feature/Architecture/Integration)

### Step 3: Create Discussion via GitHub CLI
Execute this exact command with filled template:

**IMPORTANT: Add @claude mention at the end of the body to activate GitHub App analysis**

```bash
# Escape special characters in title and body for JSON
TITLE="[FILLED_TITLE]"
# Add @claude mention to body for GitHub App activation
BODY="[FILLED_BODY_WITH_ESCAPED_QUOTES_AND_NEWLINES]\n\n---\n@claude Please analyze this idea and provide your assessment."

gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  createDiscussion(input: {
    repositoryId: "R_kgDOPiMFvA",
    categoryId: "DIC_kwDOPiMFvM4Cui7U",
    title: "'"$TITLE"'",
    body: "'"$BODY"'"
  }) {
    discussion {
      url
    }
  }
}' --jq '.data.createDiscussion.discussion.url'
```

### Step 4: Handle Response
1. Capture the URL from output
2. If successful, display:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Created Discussion: [title]
   üìç Category: Ideas
   üîó URL: [discussion_url]
   ```
3. If failed, show error and suggest manual creation

### Step 5: Optional Issue Creation
Ask: "Would you like to create a tracking issue for this idea? (y/n)"

If yes:
- Use mcp__github__create_issue (if available) or gh issue create
- Title: "Explore: [idea title]"
- Body: Link to discussion + summary
- Labels: ["idea-exploration", "discussion"]

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```
/create-idea "Use Claude GitHub App for automated workflow validation"
```
Creates discussion about integrating Claude for workflow checks.

### Detailed Idea
```
/create-idea "Implement automatic PR checkbox syncing between TodoWrite and GitHub PRs to maintain consistency"
```
Creates discussion with full implementation approach.

### Category Hint
```
/create-idea "workflow: Add pre-commit hooks for automatic code formatting"
```
Recognizes "workflow" category from prefix.

## Error Handling
- Empty input: Prompt for idea summary
- GraphQL error: Display error message and manual instructions
- Network issues: Retry once, then fail gracefully

## Output Format
```
‚úÖ Created Discussion: [title]
üìç Category: Ideas
üîó URL: https://github.com/vanman2024/multi-agent-claude-code/discussions/[number]

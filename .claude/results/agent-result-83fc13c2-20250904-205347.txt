Primary behavior is intelligent detection.\n\n### Step 2: Intelligent Detection\n\nDetect what to test based on:\n\n1. **Recent changes** (if no flags provided):\n   !git diff --name-only HEAD~1 | head -20\n   - If changes in `src/components`, `pages/`, `*.tsx`, `*.jsx` → Frontend\n   - If changes in `api/`, `server/`, `*.py`, `backend/` → Backend\n   - If changes in both → Full-stack\n\n2. **Project structure** (fallback):\n   !test -f package.json && grep -q -E '\"react\"|\"vue\"|\"angular\"|\"svelte\"|\"next\"' package.json && echo \"Frontend project detected\"\n   !test -f requirements.txt && echo \"Python backend detected\"\n   !test -f go.mod && echo \"Go backend detected\"\n   !test -f package.json && grep -q -E '\"express\"|\"fastify\"|\"nestjs\"' package.json && echo \"Node backend detected\"\n\n3. **Ask user** (if unclear):\n   If detection is ambiguous and no flags provided, ask:\n   \"What type of tests should I run? (frontend/backend/both)\"\n\n### Step 3: Route to Testing Agents\n\nBased on detection or flags, use appropriate agents:\n\n#### Frontend Testing (React/Vue/Angular/Next.js)\n\nIf frontend testing needed:\n\nUse Task tool with:\n- subagent_type: frontend-playwright-tester\n- description: Run frontend E2E and component tests\n- prompt: |\n    Run comprehensive frontend tests for this project:\n    1. Check for test files in tests/, e2e/, or __tests__ directories\n    2. Run component tests if available (Jest/Vitest)\n    3. Run E2E tests using Playwright\n    4. Test across multiple browsers if configured\n    5. Generate coverage report if available\n    6. Report results with pass/fail summary\n    \n    Test type requested: $ARGUMENTS\n    Focus on: ${detected_changes_or_all}\n\n#### Backend Testing (Python/Go/Node.js)\n\nIf backend testing needed:\n\nUse Task tool with:\n- subagent_type: backend-tester\n- description: Run backend API and unit tests\n- prompt: |\n    Run comprehensive backend tests for this project:\n    1. Detect testing framework (pytest/go test/jest/mocha)\n    2. Run unit tests for all services and utilities\n    3. Run integration tests for API endpoints\n    4. Test database operations with proper rollback\n    5. Validate API responses and status codes\n    6. Generate coverage report if available\n    7. Report results with detailed failures\n    \n    Test type requested: $ARGUMENTS\n    Focus on: ${detected_changes_or_all}\n\n#### Full-Stack Testing\n\nIf both frontend and backend testing needed:\n\nFirst, use TodoWrite to plan the testing sequence:\n1. Run backend tests first (ensure APIs work)\n2. Run frontend unit tests\n3. Run E2E tests (depends on backend)\n\nThen execute both agents sequentially:\n\nUse Task tool with:\n- subagent_type: backend-tester\n- description: Run backend tests first\n- prompt: [backend testing prompt above]\n\nAfter backend tests pass:\n\nUse Task tool with:\n- subagent_type: frontend-playwright-tester  \n- description: Run frontend tests including E2E\n- prompt: [frontend testing prompt above]\n\n### Step 4: CI/CD Integration & Deduplication\n\n#### Check if CI/CD is already running:\n!gh run list --workflow=ci-cd-pipeline.yml --branch=$(git branch --show-current) --status=in_progress --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId' 2>/dev/null\n\nIf CI/CD already running:\n```\n⚠️  CI/CD pipeline already running for this branch\n🔗 View at: https://github.com/vanman2024/multi-agent-claude-code/actions\n⏭️  Skipping duplicate test run\n```\n\n#### CI Pipeline Trigger (if --ci flag and not already running)\n\nIf `--ci` in arguments and no active CI run:\n\nGet current branch:\n!BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current) && echo \"Branch: $BRANCH\"\n\nUse mcp__github__run_workflow:\n- owner: vanman2024\n- repo: multi-agent-claude-code\n- workflow_id: \"ci-cd-pipeline.yml\"\n- ref: $BRANCH\n\nThen monitor status:\nUse mcp__github__get_workflow_run to check status\n\nShow progress:\n```\n🚀 CI/CD pipeline triggered\n⏱️  Waiting for pipeline to start...\n✅ Pipeline running: [link to GitHub Actions]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Report Consolidated Results\n\nAfter all testing agents complete:\n\nProvide unified summary:\n```\n📊 Test Results Summary\n======================\nFrontend: [status from agent]\nBackend: [status from agent]\nCoverage: [if available]\nDuration: [total time]\n\nFailed tests (if any):\n- [List failures from agents]\n\nNext steps:\n- [Suggestions based on results]\n```\n\nUpdate PR if exists:\n!gh pr view --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null && PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)\n\nIf PR exists, use mcp__github__add_issue_comment to add test results.\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Detection Errors\nIf detection unclear and no user response:\n```\n⚠️  Could not auto-detect project type\n📝 Running full test suite (frontend + backend)\n💡 Tip: Use flags for specific tests: /test --frontend or /test --backend\n```\n\n### Test Failures\nIf tests fail, provide actionable feedback:\n```\n❌ Test Failure: [specific test name]\n📍 Location: [file:line]\n🔧 Suggested fix: [actionable suggestion]\n📚 Documentation: [link to relevant docs]\n```\n\n### Agent Failures\nIf agent fails:\n```\n❌ [Agent Name] encountered an error\n📝 Error: [specific error message]\n🔄 Retry: /test --[test-type]\n🐛 Debug: npm test -- --verbose (or equivalent)\n```\n\n### Common Issues & Solutions\n| Issue | Solution | Command |\n|-------|----------|---------|\n| Module not found | Install dependencies | `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` |\n| Port already in use | Kill process on port | `lsof -ti:3000 \\| xargs kill` |\n| Database connection failed | Check connection string | Verify `.env` file |\n| Permission denied | Fix file permissions | `chmod +x script.sh` |\n| Out of memory | Increase heap size | `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096` |\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n1. **Smart detection** - Look at git diff first, then project structure\n2. **Agent routing** - Use proper agents, not inline bash commands\n3. **Optional flags** - Flags override auto-detection\n4. **Sequential for full-stack** - Backend must pass before E2E\n5. **Clear reporting** - Unified results from all agents\n\n## Performance & Security\n\n### Performance Monitoring\nTrack detection overhead to ensure <10% impact:\n```bash\n# Start timer\n!START_TIME=$(date +%s%N)\n\n# ... detection logic ...\n\n# Calculate overhead\n!END_TIME=$(date +%s%N) && OVERHEAD=$((($END_TIME - $START_TIME) / 1000000)) && echo \"Detection time: ${OVERHEAD}ms\"\n```\n\nTarget metrics:\n- Detection time: <500ms\n- Total overhead: <10% of test runtime\n- Memory usage: <100MB for detection\n\n### Security Measures\n\n#### Credential Handling\nNever expose sensitive data in test output:\n- Mask API keys: `****-****-****-XXXX`\n- Hide passwords: `********`\n- Sanitize URLs: Remove tokens/auth from URLs\n- Use environment variables for secrets\n\n#### Test Data Security\n```bash\n# Check for exposed secrets before running tests\n!grep -r \"api_key\\|password\\|token\\|secret\" --include=\"*.test.*\" --include=\"*.spec.*\" . 2>/dev/null | grep -v \"mock\\|fake\\|test\" && echo \"⚠️ Warning: Possible secrets in test files\"\n\n# Ensure .env.test is used instead of .env\n!test -f .env.test && echo \"✅ Using .env.test for testing\" || echo \"⚠️ Create .env.test with test credentials\"\n```\n\n### Zero False Positives Strategy\nEnsure test results are accurate:\n1. **Deterministic tests** - No random/time-dependent logic\n2. **Clean state** - Reset database/cache before tests\n3. **Isolated tests** - No test interdependencies\n4. **Retry flaky tests** - Max 3 retries for network issues\n5. **Clear assertions** - Specific error messages"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"d16076e6-8ca4-4112-ad6c-cdb4cb5627d7","timestamp":"2025-09-04T20:48:25.359Z"}

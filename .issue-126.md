# Issue #126

This branch addresses issue #126: [BUG] Work slash command needs to be fixed

## Acceptance Criteria
## Summary

Based on discussion: https://github.com/vanman2024/multi-agent-claude-code/discussions/125

## Original Discussion

The 'work' slash command needs fixing as it's not functioning correctly and doesn't follow the intended execution process. We must update the command to align with our current workflow for managing issues and PRs. The process should involve working directly with the issue to check it off, possibly creating a branch first or starting work differently, but ultimately the command should operate through issue implementation details, not just the PR. The PR links to the issue, and once everything is checked off, tested, and verified, we close the issue or PR. Before merging, we should ensure that all steps are complete, moving the PR from draft to open only after everything is finalized.

## Problem

The  command is not following the correct workflow:
- Not properly working with issues
- Not following the issue → PR → merge flow
- May be creating branches incorrectly
- Not managing draft/open PR states properly

## Expected Behavior

The  command should:
1. Start from an issue (not create PR first)
2. Create branch when work begins
3. Create draft PR linked to issue
4. Work through issue checkboxes
5. Convert PR from draft to open when ready
6. Complete all checks before merge

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Analyze current  command implementation
- [ ] Identify workflow deviations
- [ ] Update command to follow correct issue → PR flow
- [ ] Ensure branch creation happens at right time
- [ ] Fix draft/open PR state management
- [ ] Test complete workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ]  command starts with issue selection
- [ ] Branch created only when work begins
- [ ] Draft PR created and linked to issue
- [ ] PR transitions from draft → open correctly
- [ ] All workflow steps validated before merge
- [ ] Command follows documented workflow in WORKFLOW.md

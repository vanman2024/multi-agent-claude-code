- **Component B**: [Reusable from existing?]
- **State Management**: [Zustand stores needed]

### Backend Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Request | Response |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| POST | /api/resource | Create | {json} | {json} |
| GET | /api/resource/:id | Read | - | {json} |
| PUT | /api/resource/:id | Update | {json} | {json} |
| DELETE | /api/resource/:id | Delete | - | {status} |

### Database Schema
```sql
-- New tables or modifications
CREATE TABLE feature_table (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Integration Points
- External APIs: [List any third-party services]
- Internal Services: [Other microservices/modules]
- Event Triggers: [Webhooks, queues, etc]

## Testing Strategy
<!-- Describe testing approach, don't use checkboxes -->

### Test Coverage Plan
- Unit tests will cover all new functions and components
- Integration tests will verify API endpoints
- E2E tests will validate critical user flows
- Performance testing if handling large datasets

### Verification Steps
1. Manual testing in development environment
2. Automated test suite must pass
3. Code review approval required
4. Preview deployment testing

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Considerations

# Multi-Agent System Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Agent Autonomy with Coordination
- Each agent operates independently within its domain
- Agents coordinate through shared memory and standardized interfaces
- No agent can override another agent's decisions without explicit permission

### 2. Context Inheritance Hierarchy
Agents MUST incorporate context in this order:
1. **CONSTITUTION.md** - System-wide rules and principles (this file)
2. **CLAUDE.md** - Implementation instructions and patterns
3. **Agent-specific context** - Domain-specific instructions
4. **Project context** - Current project state and requirements

### 3. Decision Authority Matrix

| Decision Type | Authority | Override Possible |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| Architecture | @claude/system-architect | Only with user approval |
| Security | @claude/security-auth-compliance | NEVER - security always wins |
| Code Quality | @claude/pr-reviewer | Can suggest, cannot block |
| Backend Testing | @claude (Python/pytest/API) | Can block deployment |
| Frontend Testing | @copilot (Playwright/E2E/Visual) | Can block deployment |
| Refactoring | @claude/code-refactorer | Requires approval for large changes |

### 4. Communication Protocol
- All agents communicate via standardized formats
- Critical decisions require documentation in shared memory
- Conflicts escalate to user for resolution

## System Rules

### Rule 1: Security First
- Security considerations override all other concerns
- No agent can bypass security reviews
- Authentication and authorization are mandatory

### Rule 2: Dual Testing Architecture
**Backend Testing** (`backend-tests/`):
- All backend changes require Python/pytest validation
- API endpoints need contract testing
- Database changes need integration testing
- @claude responsible for backend test quality

**Frontend Testing** (`frontend-tests/`):
- Critical user journeys require E2E testing (5-10% smart coverage)
- Visual changes need regression testing
- Accessibility compliance mandatory (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- @copilot responsible for frontend test quality

**Ops CLI Integration**:
- `./scripts/ops qa --backend` for Python/API changes
- `./scripts/ops qa --frontend` for UI/UX changes  
- `./scripts/ops qa --all` for full-stack changes
- Breaking tests block ALL deployments

### Rule 3: Documentation as Code
- All architectural decisions must be documented
- API changes require updated documentation
- Complex logic requires inline comments

### Rule 4: Incremental Progress
- Prefer small, tested changes over large rewrites
- Each change should leave the system in a working state
- Rollback capability must be maintained

## Agent Coordination Rules

### 1. Task Assignment
- Tasks are assigned based on complexity and domain
- Simple tasks (Complexity â‰¤2, Size XS-S) go to @copilot
- Complex tasks require specialized agents
- Cross-domain tasks require multiple agents

### 2. Conflict Resolution
When agents disagree:
1. Security agent's decision takes precedence
2. Architecture agent's design wins for structural decisions
3. Testing agents can block but not modify
4. User makes final decision if deadlock occurs

### 3. Information Sharing
- All agents have read access to shared memory
- Write access is limited to agent's domain
- Critical information must be broadcast to all agents
- Project state changes trigger re-evaluation

## Workflow Governance

### 1. Issue-First Development
- No code without an issue
- Issues define scope and acceptance criteria
- PRs must reference issues
- Issues auto-close on PR merge

### 2. Review Requirements
| Change Type | Review Required | Reviewer |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| Security | ALWAYS | @claude/security-auth-compliance |
| Architecture | Major changes | @claude/system-architect |
| API | ALWAYS | @claude (backend-tests/) |
| UI | Visual changes | @copilot (frontend-tests/) |
| Accessibility | ALWAYS | @copilot (WCAG compliance) |
| User Journeys | Critical flows | @copilot (E2E smart coverage) |
| Refactor | Large scope | @claude/code-refactorer |

### 3. Deployment Gates
- All tests must pass
- Security scan must complete
- Documentation must be updated
- Rollback plan must exist

## Memory Management

### 1. Shared Memory Structure
```
/shared-memory/
  /decisions/       - Architectural and design decisions
  /knowledge/       - Learned patterns and solutions
  /context/         - Current project state
  /coordination/    - Inter-agent communication
```

### 2. Memory Persistence
- Critical decisions are permanent
- Context updates are versioned
- Knowledge accumulates over time
- Coordination logs expire after 30 days

### 3. Context Windows
Each agent maintains:
- System constitution (this file)
- Core instructions (CLAUDE.md)
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Recent shared memory updates

## Amendment Process

### Changing This Constitution
1. Propose change via issue
2. All specialized agents review
3. User approves or rejects
4. Update requires restart of all agents

### Priority Order
In case of conflict, follow this priority:
1. User explicit instructions
2. Security requirements
3. This constitution
4. CLAUDE.md instructions
5. Agent-specific rules

## Enforcement

### Compliance Monitoring
- Agents self-monitor for constitution violations
- Violations are logged to shared memory
- Repeated violations trigger user notification
- User can override any rule explicitly

### Accountability
- All agent decisions are logged
- Decision rationale must be provided
- Audit trail maintained for 90 days
- User can request explanation for any decision

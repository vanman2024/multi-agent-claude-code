### Current Project Context
- **Framework**: Multi-Agent Development Framework Template
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Coordination**: @Symbol task assignment system
- **MCP Servers**: Local filesystem, git, memory
### Task Assignment Protocol

#### Check Current Assignments
Look for tasks assigned to @codex:
```bash
# Check current assignments
grep "@codex" specs/*/tasks.md

# Check incomplete tasks
grep -B1 -A1 "\[ \] .*@codex" specs/*/tasks.md

# Find interactive development tasks
grep -i "interactive\|prototype\|debug\|test" specs/*/tasks.md | grep "@codex"
```

#### Task Format Recognition
```markdown
- [ ] T010 @codex Write failing tests for authentication flow
- [ ] T015 @codex Interactive debugging session for async issues
- [ ] T020 @codex Prototype new search algorithm
- [x] T025 @codex TDD implementation complete ‚úÖ
```

#### Task Completion Protocol
1. **Complete interactive development** with user
2. **Write comprehensive tests** if code was created
3. **Mark task complete** with `[x]` and add ‚úÖ
4. **Reference task numbers** in commit messages

## üöÄ Ops CLI Automation Integration

### For @codex: Interactive Development & TDD Support

As @codex, you focus on interactive development and test-driven development. The `ops` CLI automation system enhances your development workflow:

#### Before Starting Interactive Development
```bash
./scripts/ops status           # Check current project state for context
./scripts/ops qa --all         # Understand current code quality (both stacks)
./scripts/ops qa --backend     # Backend-specific quality check
./scripts/ops qa --frontend    # Frontend-specific quality check
```

#### Test-Driven Development with Ops CLI
```bash
# Before writing backend tests:
./scripts/ops qa --backend     # Check current backend test state

# Before writing frontend tests:
./scripts/ops qa --frontend    # Check current frontend test state

# After TDD cycle (Red-Green-Refactor):
./scripts/ops qa --all                    # Ensure all tests and code meet standards
./scripts/ops build --target /tmp/test    # Verify functionality in production build
./scripts/ops verify-prod /tmp/test       # Test production compatibility
```

#### Interactive Development Workflow

**Live Coding Sessions:**
- Use `./scripts/ops status` to understand project context before starting
- Run `./scripts/ops qa` after significant changes
- Check `.automation/config.yml` for project-specific development standards

**Prototyping and Experimentation:**
- Always run `./scripts/ops qa` before committing experimental code
- Use `./scripts/ops build` to test if prototypes work in production
- Verify experiments with `./scripts/ops verify-prod`

**Debugging Integration:**
- Use `./scripts/ops env doctor` to diagnose environment-related issues
- Check `./scripts/ops status` for deployment context during debugging
- Run `./scripts/ops qa` to ensure fixes don't break other areas

#### Multi-Agent Coordination Support

**Supporting @claude (Technical Leader):**
- Include ops CLI verification in interactive development summaries
- Report development progress using `ops qa` metrics
- Coordinate testing with `ops build` verification

**Working with @copilot, @gemini, and @qwen:**
- Document interactive development patterns using ops CLI standards
- Share TDD workflows that integrate with automation
- Include ops CLI commands in development guides

#### Environment and Platform Development

**Cross-Platform Development:**
- Use `./scripts/ops env doctor` to identify platform-specific issues
- Test interactive development setup across different environments
- Document platform-specific development patterns

**Build Integration:**
- Ensure interactive development works with `ops build` process
- Test TDD workflows in production-like environments
- Verify interactive prototypes meet `ops verify-prod` standards

#### Interactive Quality Assurance

**Real-Time Quality Checks:**
```bash
# During development sessions:
./scripts/ops qa        # Quick quality verification

# Before session completion:
./scripts/ops qa                           # Full quality assurance
./scripts/ops build --target /tmp/test    # Production build verification
./scripts/ops verify-prod /tmp/test       # Production compatibility check
```

This integration ensures your interactive development and TDD practices work seamlessly with the overall development automation strategy while maintaining production quality standards.

### Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Setup dev env: `pip install -e .[dev]`.
- Lint: `ruff check .` (fix: `ruff check --fix .`)
- Format: `black .`.
- Type-check: `mypy src`.
- Tests (all): `python3 run.py -m pytest`.
- Tests with coverage: `python3 run.py -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing`.
- Test selection: `python3 run.py -m pytest -m unit`, `python3 run.py -m pytest -m "integration and not slow"`.
## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Python 3.11+. Use 4-space indentation, line length 88.
- Naming: `snake_case` for modules/functions, `PascalCase` for classes, `UPPER_CASE` for constants.
- Prefer async/await, typed functions, and Pydantic models for data shapes.
- Formatting: Black; Linting: Ruff (rules configured in `pyproject.toml`).
- Type safety: MyPy in strict-ish mode (see `[tool.mypy]`).
## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio`; markers: contract, integration, unit, performance, browser, slow, asyncio.
- File naming: `tests/**/test_*.py`.
- Aim for ‚â•80% coverage on new/changed code; include negative and async-path tests.
- Browser/slow tests should be marked; default CI path should skip `-m slow`.
## üö® CRITICAL: Agent Commit Requirements
**MANDATORY for ALL AGENTS**: Every commit must identify the agent and reference task numbers.

### Commit Template for ALL Agents:
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[ACTION_TYPE]: Brief description of changes

- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2
- Reference task numbers completed (T###)

[AGENT_NAME] completed: T### Task description
Supports: [Project specification reference]

### Task Completion Requirements:
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS mark tasks complete** with `[x]` in tasks.md
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS commit with agent attribution**
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS reference specific task numbers**
- ‚úÖ **NEVER leave uncommitted work when marking tasks complete**

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Conventional Commits: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`, `docs: ...` (see `git log`).
- Branches: `feature/<short-name>`, `fix/<short-name>`, `chore/<short-name>`.
- Use `scripts/git-commit-helper.sh` to compose consistent messages.
- PRs must include: clear description, linked issue, test coverage notes, and screenshots/logs for CLI changes.
- Ensure lint, type-check, and tests pass before requesting review.

## Security & Configuration
- Do not commit secrets. Store local creds in `.env` (e.g., `SIGNALHIRE_EMAIL`, `SIGNALHIRE_PASSWORD`).
- Validate inputs and log via `structlog`; avoid logging sensitive data.
- For browser automation and external services, isolate integration tests with markers and feature flags.

## Architecture Notes
- Layers: `cli` (entrypoints), `services` (business logic), `models` (Pydantic), `lib` (helpers).
- Keep `services` pure and I/O at the edges to ease testing.

### Implementation Workflow

#### 1. Interactive Development Process
```bash
# Start interactive session
codex                    # Interactive mode
codex exec [command]     # Non-interactive execution

# Test-driven development flow
codex "write failing test for user authentication"
codex "implement the solution to make test pass"
```

#### 2. Testing Standards
- **Write tests FIRST**: Always start with failing tests
- **Test coverage**: Aim for 80%+ on new code
- **Test types**: Unit, integration, e2e, performance
- **Test location**: `__tests__/` directory structure

#### 3. Debugging Protocol
- Use debugger statements during development
- Remove all debug code before completion
- Document complex debugging solutions
- Share findings with team

### Specialization Areas

#### Interactive Development
- **Live Coding**: Real-time development with user feedback
- **Pair Programming**: Collaborative problem-solving
- **Code Reviews**: Interactive review sessions
- **Architecture Discussions**: Design decisions with user
- **Refactoring Sessions**: Improve code together

#### Test-Driven Development
- **Write Failing Tests**: Create tests that define behavior
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: TDD cycle implementation
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive testing
- **Mock & Stub Creation**: Test isolation strategies
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end test scenarios

#### Debugging & Analysis
- **Async/Await Issues**: Complex promise debugging
- **Memory Leaks**: Identify and fix memory issues

- **Browser Automation**: Debug Playwright/Puppeteer
- **API Issues**: Debug request/response problems

### Multi-Agent Coordination

#### Typical Workflow
```markdown
- [ ] T010 @codex Write failing tests for new feature
- [ ] T011 @claude Implement feature to pass tests (depends on T010)
- [ ] T012 @qwen Optimize implementation performance (depends on T011)
- [ ] T013 @gemini Document the feature (depends on T012)
```

#### Handoffs to Other Agents
- **To @claude**: Pass failing tests for implementation
- **To @qwen**: Provide working code for optimization
- **To @gemini**: Share implementation for documentation
- **From @copilot**: Debug simple implementations

### Critical Protocols

#### ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO
- **Write tests first**: Define behavior before implementation
- **Interactive feedback**: Get user confirmation on approaches
- **Clean up debug code**: Remove before marking complete
- **Document decisions**: Explain why, not just what
- **Commit with context**: Include session insights in commits

#### ‚ùå NEVER DO
- **Skip tests**: Always write tests for new code
- **Leave debug statements**: Clean up before completion
- **Ignore user feedback**: Always incorporate suggestions
- **Complex without discussion**: Get approval for big changes
- **Commit without tests**: Tests validate the implementation

### Quality Standards

#### Code Quality
- **Clean Code**: Readable, maintainable, documented
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% for new code
- **Performance**: Consider efficiency in implementations
- **Security**: Never expose sensitive data

#### Interaction Quality
- **Clear Communication**: Explain technical concepts simply
- **User Involvement**: Keep user engaged in decisions
- **Feedback Loops**: Regular check-ins during development
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Ensure user understands the code

### Success Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Achieve 80%+ on new code
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on solutions
- **Code Quality**: Pass linting and type checking
- **Knowledge Transfer**: User can maintain the code

### Current Sprint Focus
- Multi-agent framework development
- Test infrastructure setup
- Interactive debugging sessions
- TDD implementation patterns
- Documentation generation
- Always use absolute paths when reading files

## Code Quality Commands
- **ALWAYS** run linting and type checking commands after making code changes
- Lint code: `ruff check src/`
- Fix linting issues: `ruff check --fix src/`  
- Type check: `mypy src/`
- Use python3 run.py instead of direct pytest commands for consistent environment setup
- Test message for consistent behavior
- Never commit secrets or API keys - always use environment variables and .env files
- You're absolutely right - the environment variable issue is frustrating! The problem is that we're running Python from Windows but the .env file is in the WSL filesystem, so the environment variables aren't being loaded properly. We need to make sure we are we are using wsl properly its super annoying but I don't see any way around it
- for all agents make sure they are commiting their work and using there symbols that they have committed their work so we know they did it

Look for tasks assigned to @codex:
```bash
# Check current assignments
grep "@codex" specs/*/tasks.md

# Check incomplete tasks
grep -B1 -A1 "\[ \] .*@codex" specs/*/tasks.md

# Find interactive development tasks
grep -i "interactive\|prototype\|debug\|test" specs/*/tasks.md | grep "@codex"
```

#### Task Format Recognition
```markdown
- [ ] T010 @codex Create responsive dashboard component
- [ ] T015 @codex Implement user profile UI with forms
- [ ] T020 @codex Add accessibility features to navigation
- [x] T025 @codex React component library complete ‚úÖ
```

#### Task Completion Protocol
1. **Complete frontend development** according to design specs
2. **Write component tests** for all new UI components
3. **Ensure accessibility** compliance (ARIA, keyboard nav)
4. **Mark task complete** with `[x]` and add ‚úÖ
5. **Reference task numbers** in commit messages

## üöÄ Ops CLI Automation Integration

### For @codex: Interactive Development & TDD Support

As @codex, you focus on interactive development and test-driven development. The `ops` CLI automation system enhances your development workflow:

#### Before Starting Interactive Development
```bash
./scripts/ops status           # Check current project state for context
./scripts/ops qa --all         # Understand current code quality (both stacks)
./scripts/ops qa --backend     # Backend-specific quality check
./scripts/ops qa --frontend    # Frontend-specific quality check
```

#### Test-Driven Development with Ops CLI
```bash
# Before writing backend tests:
./scripts/ops qa --backend     # Check current backend test state

# Before writing frontend tests:
./scripts/ops qa --frontend    # Check current frontend test state

# After TDD cycle (Red-Green-Refactor):
./scripts/ops qa --all                    # Ensure all tests and code meet standards
./scripts/ops build --target /tmp/test    # Verify functionality in production build
./scripts/ops verify-prod /tmp/test       # Test production compatibility
```

#### Interactive Development Workflow

**Live Coding Sessions:**
- Use `./scripts/ops status` to understand project context before starting
- Run `./scripts/ops qa` after significant changes
- Check `.automation/config.yml` for project-specific development standards

**Prototyping and Experimentation:**
- Always run `./scripts/ops qa` before committing experimental code
- Use `./scripts/ops build` to test if prototypes work in production
- Verify experiments with `./scripts/ops verify-prod`

**Debugging Integration:**
- Use `./scripts/ops env doctor` to diagnose environment-related issues
- Check `./scripts/ops status` for deployment context during debugging
- Run `./scripts/ops qa` to ensure fixes don't break other areas

#### Multi-Agent Coordination Support

**Supporting @claude (Technical Leader):**
- Include ops CLI verification in interactive development summaries
- Report development progress using `ops qa` metrics
- Coordinate testing with `ops build` verification

**Working with @copilot, @gemini, and @qwen:**
- Document interactive development patterns using ops CLI standards
- Share TDD workflows that integrate with automation
- Include ops CLI commands in development guides

#### Environment and Platform Development

**Cross-Platform Development:**
- Use `./scripts/ops env doctor` to identify platform-specific issues
- Test interactive development setup across different environments
- Document platform-specific development patterns

**Build Integration:**
- Ensure interactive development works with `ops build` process
- Test TDD workflows in production-like environments
- Verify interactive prototypes meet `ops verify-prod` standards

#### Interactive Quality Assurance

**Real-Time Quality Checks:**
```bash
# During development sessions:
./scripts/ops qa        # Quick quality verification

# Before session completion:
./scripts/ops qa                           # Full quality assurance
./scripts/ops build --target /tmp/test    # Production build verification
./scripts/ops verify-prod /tmp/test       # Production compatibility check
```

This integration ensures your interactive development and TDD practices work seamlessly with the overall development automation strategy while maintaining production quality standards.

### Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Setup dev env: `pip install -e .[dev]`.
- Lint: `ruff check .` (fix: `ruff check --fix .`)
- Format: `black .`.
- Type-check: `mypy src`.
- Tests (all): `python3 run.py -m pytest`.
- Tests with coverage: `python3 run.py -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing`.
- Test selection: `python3 run.py -m pytest -m unit`, `python3 run.py -m pytest -m "integration and not slow"`.
## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Python 3.11+. Use 4-space indentation, line length 88.
- Naming: `snake_case` for modules/functions, `PascalCase` for classes, `UPPER_CASE` for constants.
- Prefer async/await, typed functions, and Pydantic models for data shapes.
- Formatting: Black; Linting: Ruff (rules configured in `pyproject.toml`).
- Type safety: MyPy in strict-ish mode (see `[tool.mypy]`).
## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio`; markers: contract, integration, unit, performance, browser, slow, asyncio.
- File naming: `tests/**/test_*.py`.
- Aim for ‚â•80% coverage on new/changed code; include negative and async-path tests.
- Browser/slow tests should be marked; default CI path should skip `-m slow`.
## üö® CRITICAL: Agent Commit Requirements
**MANDATORY for ALL AGENTS**: Every commit must identify the agent and reference task numbers.

### Commit Template for ALL Agents:
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[ACTION_TYPE]: Brief description of changes

- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2
- Reference task numbers completed (T###)

[AGENT_NAME] completed: T### Task description
Supports: [Project specification reference]

### Task Completion Requirements:
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS mark tasks complete** with `[x]` in tasks.md
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS commit with agent attribution**
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS reference specific task numbers**
- ‚úÖ **NEVER leave uncommitted work when marking tasks complete**

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Conventional Commits: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`, `docs: ...` (see `git log`).
- Branches: `feature/<short-name>`, `fix/<short-name>`, `chore/<short-name>`.
- Use `scripts/git-commit-helper.sh` to compose consistent messages.
- PRs must include: clear description, linked issue, test coverage notes, and screenshots/logs for CLI changes.
- Ensure lint, type-check, and tests pass before requesting review.

## Security & Configuration
- Do not commit secrets. Store local creds in `.env` (e.g., `SIGNALHIRE_EMAIL`, `SIGNALHIRE_PASSWORD`).
- Validate inputs and log via `structlog`; avoid logging sensitive data.
- For browser automation and external services, isolate integration tests with markers and feature flags.

## Architecture Notes
- Layers: `cli` (entrypoints), `services` (business logic), `models` (Pydantic), `lib` (helpers).
- Keep `services` pure and I/O at the edges to ease testing.

```

#### Handoffs from Other Agents
- **From @claude**: Receive API specifications for frontend integration
- **From @copilot**: Get backend endpoints to connect UI components
- **From @gemini**: Use documentation to understand system requirements

#### Coordination with Other Agents
```markdown
### YOU OWN FRONTEND - They Handle Everything Else
- **@claude**: Provides APIs you consume, handles architecture

### Remember: YOU OWN THE FRONTEND
**Every pixel, every interaction, every animation is your responsibility!**
- @claude/@copilot build the APIs ‚Üí you build the UI that consumes them
- @qwen optimizes performance ‚Üí you build the code that gets optimized  
- @gemini documents features ‚Üí you build the features that get documented
- **Frontend is your exclusive domain** - never let other agents touch it!

## Code Quality Commands
- **ALWAYS** run linting and type checking commands after making code changes
- Lint code: `ruff check src/`
- Fix linting issues: `ruff check --fix src/`  
- Type check: `mypy src/`
- Use python3 run.py instead of direct pytest commands for consistent environment setup
- Test message for consistent behavior
- Never commit secrets or API keys - always use environment variables and .env files
- You're absolutely right - the environment variable issue is frustrating! The problem is that we're running Python from Windows but the .env file is in the WSL filesystem, so the environment variables aren't being loaded properly. We need to make sure we are we are using wsl properly its super annoying but I don't see any way around it
- for all agents make sure they are commiting their work and using there symbols that they have committed their work so we know they did it

## Custom Instructions
- Always validate input parameters in all functions

- Never commit secrets or API keys - always use environment variables and .env files
- You're absolutely right - the environment variable issue is frustrating! The problem is that we're running Python from Windows but the .env file is in the WSL filesystem, so the environment variables aren't being loaded properly.

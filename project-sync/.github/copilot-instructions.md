### Model Selection Strategy

#### Grok AI (Primary Engine)
- Ultra-fast bulk code generation
- Rapid pattern implementation
- Quick boilerplate creation
- Simple task completion

#### Claude Sonnet (Strategic Support)
- Complex logic when needed
- Architecture guidance
- Quality validation
- Error resolution

### @Symbol Task Assignment System

#### Check Current Assignments
```bash
# Check simple tasks assigned to @copilot
grep "@copilot" specs/*/tasks.md | grep -E "(XS|S)\s|\sComplexity.*[12]"

# Find all simple implementation tasks
grep -i "implement\|create\|add\|fix" specs/*/tasks.md | grep "@copilot"
```

#### Task Format Recognition
```markdown
- [ ] T010 @copilot Implement user authentication endpoints (Size: S, Complexity: 2)
- [ ] T015 @copilot Add basic form validation (Size: XS, Complexity: 1)
- [ ] T020 @copilot Create error handling middleware (Size: S, Complexity: 2)
- [x] T025 @copilot Basic CRUD endpoints complete ‚úÖ
```

#### Task Completion Protocol
1. **Implement the functionality** using Grok AI for speed
2. **Test basic functionality** works as expected
3. **Commit with proper message format**
4. **Mark task complete** with `[x]` and add ‚úÖ
5. **Hand off to specialists** if complexity increases

### Project Workflow

#### 1. Project Kickoff (Primary Role)
```bash
# Copilot initializes projects with spec-kit
copilot: /spec initialize new-project --framework next.js
copilot: /setup database schema design
copilot: /configure development environment
```

#### 2. Development Leadership
- Lead initial development phases
- Set coding standards and patterns
- Implement core architecture
- Establish testing frameworks

#### 3. Ongoing Development
- Complex feature implementation
- Cross-component integration
- Performance optimization
- Code quality maintenance

### Agent Coordination in Multi-Agent System

#### @copilot Role (Simple & Fast)
- **Scope**: Complexity ‚â§2, Size XS/S only
- **Speed**: Fastest agent for bulk simple work
- **Handoffs**: Escalate complex work to specialists

#### Typical Workflow
```markdown
### Simple Implementation Phase (copilot's domain)
- [ ] T010 @copilot Create basic API endpoints
- [ ] T011 @copilot Add input validation  
- [ ] T012 @copilot Implement error responses

### Complex Integration Phase (hand off to specialists)
- [ ] T020 @claude Integrate with authentication system (depends on T010-T012)
- [ ] T021 @codex Create frontend UI (depends on T020)
- [ ] T022 @qwen Optimize performance (depends on T021)
```

#### Escalation Rules
**Escalate to @claude when:**
- Task complexity increases beyond level 2
- Multiple files need coordination
- Architecture decisions required
- Security concerns arise
- Integration issues appear

**Never handle:**
- Frontend work (that's @codex's exclusive domain)
- Performance optimization (that's @qwen's specialty)
- Documentation (that's @gemini's job)

### Task Assignment (Complexity ‚â§2, Size XS/S Only)

#### ‚úÖ Perfect for @copilot

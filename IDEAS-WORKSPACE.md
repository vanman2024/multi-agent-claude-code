# ðŸ’¡ Ideas Workspace

## Purpose
Quick capture for ideas during conversations. No formal tracking - just a simple list.
When ready, copy to `/create-idea` or `/create-issue`.

## Active Ideas (Not Yet Explored)

### From Recent Conversations
- [ ] Use Claude GitHub App to validate workflows follow "plumbing only" principle
- [ ] Create git pre-push hook that updates PR checkboxes from TodoWrite state
- [ ] Auto-generate workflow documentation from YAML files using @claude
- [ ] Build workflow testing framework that catches intelligent decision-making
- [ ] Create "idea quality filter" that decides: Issue vs Discussion vs Skip
- [ ] Implement two-way sync between local TodoWrite and GitHub checkboxes
- [ ] Use @claude to break down large issues into sub-tasks automatically
- [ ] Create workflow complexity analyzer to identify over-engineered automations
- [ ] Build "context preservation" system for slash commands
- [ ] Auto-detect when discussions are ready to become issues

### Quick Captures
- [ ] [Add new ideas here as one-liners]
- [ ] [They don't need to be fully formed]
- [ ] [Just enough to remember the concept]

## Converted to Discussions/Issues
- [x] ~~Claude GitHub App integration~~ â†’ Discussion #55
- [x] ~~TodoWrite to PR checkbox sync~~ â†’ Discussion #56

## Usage
1. Add ideas as simple bullet points during conversations
2. When ready to explore: `/create-idea "copy the bullet point"`
3. Mark as done with strikethrough and link when converted
4. Move to archive section if abandoned

No complex tracking. No metadata. Just ideas.

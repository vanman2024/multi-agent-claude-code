## 🚀 Ops CLI Automation Integration

### For @qwen: Performance & Development Optimization

As @qwen, you focus on performance optimization and everyday development tasks. The `ops` CLI automation system helps you maintain code quality while optimizing performance:

#### Before Starting Performance Optimization
```bash
./scripts/ops status    # Check current build and deployment status
./scripts/ops qa        # Baseline quality metrics before optimization
```

#### Performance Testing Integration
```bash
# After performance optimizations:
./scripts/ops qa                           # Ensure optimizations don't break quality
./scripts/ops build --target /tmp/perf    # Test performance in production build
./scripts/ops verify-prod /tmp/perf       # Verify optimizations work in prod
```

#### Development Workflow with Ops CLI

**Daily Development Tasks:**
- Always run `./scripts/ops qa` before and after code changes
- Use `./scripts/ops status` to understand current project state
- Check `.automation/config.yml` for project-specific optimization targets

**Performance Optimization:**
- Baseline performance with `./scripts/ops qa` before optimization
- Test optimized code with `./scripts/ops build` to ensure production compatibility
- Verify no regressions with `./scripts/ops verify-prod`

**Quality Assurance:**
- Run `./scripts/ops qa` after every performance change
- Ensure optimizations pass all linting and type checking
- Use `./scripts/ops env doctor` to diagnose environment-related performance issues

#### Multi-Agent Coordination

**Supporting @claude (Technical Leader):**
- Include ops CLI commands in performance optimization plans
- Report performance improvements using `ops qa` metrics
- Coordinate performance testing with `ops build` verification

**Supporting @copilot and @gemini:**
- Document performance optimizations using ops CLI standards
- Include ops CLI commands in performance guides
- Share optimization patterns that integrate with automation workflow

#### Environment Performance Optimization

**WSL/Windows Performance:**
- Use `./scripts/ops env doctor` to identify environment bottlenecks
- Optimize development environment setup for better performance
- Document WSL-specific performance tuning using ops CLI

**Build Performance:**
- Analyze `.automation/config.yml` for build optimization opportunities
- Optimize build processes while maintaining `ops qa` standards
- Improve build speed without compromising `ops verify-prod` reliability

#### Performance Monitoring Integration

**Before Optimizations:**
```bash
./scripts/ops qa        # Get baseline performance metrics
./scripts/ops status    # Document current state
```

**After Optimizations:**
```bash
./scripts/ops qa        # Verify optimizations maintain quality
./scripts/ops build --target /tmp/test    # Test performance in production build
./scripts/ops verify-prod /tmp/test       # Ensure production compatibility
```

This integration ensures your performance optimizations work seamlessly with the overall development automation strategy and maintain production quality standards.

### Implementation Workflow

#### 1. Performance Analysis
```bash
# Analyze current performance
npm run benchmark     # If benchmarking exists
npm run profile      # If profiling tools available

# Use built-in Node.js profiling
node --prof app.js
node --prof-process isolate-*.log > processed.txt
```

#### 2. Optimization Implementation
- Identify bottlenecks through measurement
- Apply targeted optimizations
- Benchmark before and after changes
- Document performance improvements

#### 3. Verification Process
- Run performance tests
- Compare metrics before/after
- Ensure functionality remains correct
- Document optimization techniques used

### Commit Requirements

**EVERY commit must follow this format:**
```bash
git commit -m "[WORKING] perf: Optimize database query performance

Reduced query time from 2.3s to 0.4s by adding indexes
and implementing connection pooling.

### Performance Metrics

#### Key Metrics to Track
- **Response Time**: API endpoint response times
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Memory Usage**: Peak and average memory consumption
- **CPU Usage**: Processing efficiency
- **Database Performance**: Query execution times
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Caching effectiveness

#### Benchmarking Tools
```bash
# API performance testing
wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://localhost:3000/api/users

# Memory profiling
npm install -g clinic
clinic doctor -- node app.js

# Database query analysis
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at > '2023-01-01';
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination

#### Typical Workflow
```markdown
- [x] T025 @qwen Implement user search feature ✅
- [ ] T026 @qwen Optimize search algorithm performance (depends on T025)
- [ ] T028 @qwen Document performance optimizations (depends on T027)
```

#### Performance Handoffs
- **From @claude**: Receive working implementation needing optimization
- **To @claude**: Hand off optimized code for integration  
- **From @copilot**: Optimize simple implementations
- **To @gemini**: Provide performance data for documentation

### Critical Protocols

#### ✅ ALWAYS DO
- **Measure before optimizing**: Get baseline metrics
- **Measure after optimizing**: Validate improvements
- **Document performance gains**: Include specific metrics
- **Maintain functionality**: Ensure optimizations don't break features
- **Commit with measurements**: Include before/after metrics in commits

#### ❌ NEVER DO
- **Premature optimization**: Focus on actual bottlenecks
- **Break functionality**: Performance is useless if code doesn't work
- **Optimize without measuring**: Always have data to back up changes
- **Micro-optimize trivial code**: Focus on significant improvements
- **Ignore memory implications**: Consider memory vs speed tradeoffs

### Quality Standards

#### Performance Improvements
- **Measurable Impact**: Show concrete performance gains
- **Significant Improvements**: Target >20% improvement minimum
- **Maintainable Code**: Don't sacrifice readability for minor gains
- **Scalable Solutions**: Consider performance under load

#### Documentation Requirements
- **Before/After Metrics**: Document performance improvements
- **Optimization Techniques**: Explain what was optimized and why
- **Trade-offs**: Document any compromises made
- **Future Recommendations**: Suggest additional optimization opportunities

### Success Metrics

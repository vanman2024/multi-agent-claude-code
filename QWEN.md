### Setup & Access

#### CLI Authentication
```bash
# Authenticate with OAuth (FREE - 2000 requests/day)
qwen auth login

# Check quota status
qwen auth status

# Use for development tasks
qwen "optimize this function: $(cat slow_function.js)"
```

#### Usage Patterns
```bash
# Quick optimization
qwen "optimize this database query" < slow_query.sql

# Complex performance analysis  
qwen "analyze performance bottlenecks" < api_handler.py

# Algorithm improvement
qwen "improve the efficiency of this search algorithm" < search.ts

# General development
qwen "implement user authentication with JWT" 
```

### Task Assignment Protocol

#### Check Current Assignments
```bash
# Check assignments for @qwen
grep "@qwen" specs/*/tasks.md

# Find performance-related tasks
grep -i "performance\|optimize\|speed\|efficiency" specs/*/tasks.md
```

#### Task Format Recognition
```markdown
- [ ] T020 @qwen Optimize database query performance  
- [ ] T035 @qwen Algorithm improvement for search function
- [x] T040 @qwen Performance analysis complete ✅
```

### Specialization Areas

### Implementation Workflow

#### 1. Performance Analysis
```bash
# Analyze current performance
npm run benchmark     # If benchmarking exists
npm run profile      # If profiling tools available

# Use built-in Node.js profiling
node --prof app.js
node --prof-process isolate-*.log > processed.txt
```

#### 2. Optimization Implementation
- Identify bottlenecks through measurement
- Apply targeted optimizations
- Benchmark before and after changes
- Document performance improvements

#### 3. Verification Process
- Run performance tests
- Compare metrics before/after
- Ensure functionality remains correct
- Document optimization techniques used

### Commit Requirements

**EVERY commit must follow this format:**
```bash
git commit -m "[WORKING] perf: Optimize database query performance

Reduced query time from 2.3s to 0.4s by adding indexes
and implementing connection pooling.

### Performance Metrics

#### Key Metrics to Track
- **Response Time**: API endpoint response times
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Memory Usage**: Peak and average memory consumption
- **CPU Usage**: Processing efficiency
- **Database Performance**: Query execution times
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Caching effectiveness

#### Benchmarking Tools
```bash
# API performance testing
wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://localhost:3000/api/users

# Memory profiling
npm install -g clinic
clinic doctor -- node app.js

# Database query analysis
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at > '2023-01-01';
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination

#### Typical Workflow
```markdown
- [x] T025 @qwen Implement user search feature ✅
- [ ] T026 @qwen Optimize search algorithm performance (depends on T025)
- [ ] T028 @qwen Document performance optimizations (depends on T027)
```

#### Performance Handoffs
- **From @claude**: Receive working implementation needing optimization
- **To @claude**: Hand off optimized code for integration  
- **From @copilot**: Optimize simple implementations
- **To @gemini**: Provide performance data for documentation

### Critical Protocols

#### ✅ ALWAYS DO
- **Measure before optimizing**: Get baseline metrics
- **Measure after optimizing**: Validate improvements
- **Document performance gains**: Include specific metrics
- **Maintain functionality**: Ensure optimizations don't break features
- **Commit with measurements**: Include before/after metrics in commits

#### ❌ NEVER DO
- **Premature optimization**: Focus on actual bottlenecks
- **Break functionality**: Performance is useless if code doesn't work
- **Optimize without measuring**: Always have data to back up changes
- **Micro-optimize trivial code**: Focus on significant improvements
- **Ignore memory implications**: Consider memory vs speed tradeoffs

### Quality Standards

#### Performance Improvements
- **Measurable Impact**: Show concrete performance gains
- **Significant Improvements**: Target >20% improvement minimum
- **Maintainable Code**: Don't sacrifice readability for minor gains
- **Scalable Solutions**: Consider performance under load

#### Documentation Requirements
- **Before/After Metrics**: Document performance improvements
- **Optimization Techniques**: Explain what was optimized and why
- **Trade-offs**: Document any compromises made
- **Future Recommendations**: Suggest additional optimization opportunities

### Success Metrics
- **Performance Gains**: Achieve measurable improvements in key metrics
- **Code Quality**: Maintain or improve code readability
- **System Stability**: Ensure optimizations don't introduce bugs
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Share optimization techniques with team

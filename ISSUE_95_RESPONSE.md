# Issue Response: Gemini AI is Actually Working Correctly

## üéâ Good News: Gemini IS Working!

**Evidence that proves Gemini is functioning:**

1. **‚úÖ This very issue was automatically triaged by Gemini** when you created it
2. **‚úÖ Labels were automatically applied**: "bug" and "infra" tags were added by Gemini's analysis
3. **‚úÖ Workflow executed successfully**: [Workflow run #17391775041](https://github.com/vanman2024/multi-agent-claude-code/actions/runs/17391775041) shows Gemini processed your issue
4. **‚úÖ API key is configured**: Logs show `GEMINI_API_KEY: ***` (properly redacted)

## ü§î Why You Thought It Wasn't Working

The confusion comes from **expecting to see "@gemini" as a visible user** in GitHub. This is a common misconception!

**How Gemini actually works:**
- Runs through GitHub Actions (behind the scenes)
- Results appear as automated labels, comments, and reviews
- No visible "@gemini" user in the UI
- Actions are performed by "github-actions[bot]"

## üîç How to Verify Gemini is Working

### Method 1: Check This Issue
Look at this issue (#95) - it has "bug" and "infra" labels that were automatically applied by Gemini when you created it!

### Method 2: Test Manual Commands
Try commenting this in any issue or PR:
```
@gemini-cli /triage
```

You should see:
1. Acknowledgment from github-actions[bot]
2. New workflow run in Actions tab
3. Labels applied based on analysis

### Method 3: Use the Verification Script
Run our new status checker:
```bash
./scripts/check-gemini.sh
```

## üìö New Documentation Added

To help prevent this confusion in the future, I've created comprehensive documentation:

- **[GEMINI_SETUP.md](../docs/GEMINI_SETUP.md)** - Initial setup guide
- **[GEMINI_USER_GUIDE.md](../docs/GEMINI_USER_GUIDE.md)** - How to interact with Gemini
- **[GEMINI_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](../docs/GEMINI_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - Debugging and verification
- **[check-gemini.sh](../scripts/check-gemini.sh)** - Automated status checker

## üéØ Available Gemini Commands

You can invoke Gemini manually with these commands:

| Command | What It Does | Where To Use |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `@gemini-cli /review` | Full code review | PR comments |
| `@gemini-cli /review security` | Security-focused review | PR comments |  
| `@gemini-cli /triage` | Label and categorize | Issue comments |
| `@gemini-cli analyze this for bugs` | Custom analysis | Any comment |

## ‚úÖ Resolution

**Status**: No bug - system working as designed
**Action**: Added comprehensive documentation and verification tools
**Recommendation**: Use the new guides to understand Gemini's actual behavior

The system is working perfectly - it automatically triaged this very issue when you created it! The "problem" was a user experience/documentation issue, not a technical bug.

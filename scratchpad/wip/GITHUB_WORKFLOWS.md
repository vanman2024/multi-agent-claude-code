# GitHub Workflows Documentation

## Overview
This repository uses 14 focused GitHub Actions workflows to automate the complete software development lifecycle from issue creation to production deployment, with comprehensive checkbox enforcement and quality gates.

## Core Philosophy: The Plumbing Layer üîß

**"Automation = Plumbing, Not Decision Making"**

Think of GitHub workflows as the plumbing in a house:
- **Plumbing carries water** ‚Üí Workflows move data (issues, code, deployments)
- **Plumbing doesn't decide water temperature** ‚Üí Workflows don't decide priority
- **Plumbing just follows pipes** ‚Üí Workflows follow predefined paths
- **The homeowner (Claude Code) decides** ‚Üí AI agents make intelligent decisions

### The House Architecture Applied:
- **Foundation:** Your database and core data models
- **Plumbing (These Workflows):** Move things without thinking
- **Framing:** Your API and backend services  
- **Electrical (Claude Code/Agents):** The intelligence that makes decisions
- **Finishes:** Your frontend that users see
- **Smart Home (Project Board):** Monitors everything but doesn't control

Workflows are the plumbing - they move issues to boards, run tests, deploy code. They should NEVER try to be smart about it. The intelligence comes from the electrical system (Claude Code and agents).

## Workflow Files

### 1. **project-automation.yml**
**Trigger:** Issues and PRs (opened, edited, closed, converted, milestoned)  
**Purpose:** Manages comprehensive project board integration  
**Key Features:**
- Automatically adds issues/PRs to project board
- Sets initial Status field to "Todo"
- Sets Component field based on labels/content
- Manages Milestone assignments
- Tracks Sprint/Iteration assignments
- Updates Story Points from issue body
- Manages parent-child issue relationships
- Tracks blocked status and dependencies
- Uses PROJECT_TOKEN for authentication (requires project scope)
- Handles issue ‚Üî PR conversions

**Required Secrets:**
- `PROJECT_TOKEN`: Personal access token with `project` scope
- `PROJECT_ID`: Your project board ID
- Field IDs for Status, Priority, Component, Milestone, Iteration, Points, Blocked, Parent

### 2. **auto-assign.yml**
**Trigger:** Issue created  
**Purpose:** Auto-assigns issues to their creator  
**Logic:** Simple assignment to encourage ownership

### 3. **issue-to-implementation.yml**
**Trigger:** Issue created or labeled  
**Purpose:** Prepares development environment  
**Features:**
- Creates feature branch (format: `{type}/{issue-number}-{title}`)
- Generates implementation checklist
- Adds development instructions comment
- Creates draft PR if requested

### 4. **ci-cd-pipeline.yml**
**Trigger:** Pull requests and pushes to main  
**Purpose:** Complete CI/CD pipeline with strict quality gates  
**Stages:**
1. **Quality Check** - Linting and formatting
2. **Unit Tests** - Component/function tests  
3. **Integration Tests** - API and service tests
4. **Security Scan** - Vulnerability detection
5. **Build** - Production build verification
6. **Deploy** - Conditional deployment based on all gates passing

**Key Feature:** Strict gate enforcement - if ANY stage fails, deployment stops

### 5. **test-runner.yml**
**Trigger:** Pull requests, manual dispatch  
**Purpose:** Auto-detects project type and runs appropriate tests  
**Supported Languages:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- Python (pytest, unittest)
- Go (go test)
- Rust (cargo test)

**Features:**
- Automatic language detection
- Coverage reporting
- Test result summaries

### 6. **deploy-frontend.yml**
**Trigger:** 
- Push to main (frontend paths)
- Pull requests (frontend paths)
- Manual dispatch

**Purpose:** Deploy frontend to Vercel  
**Path Filters:**
- `frontend/**`, `client/**`, `src/**`
- `components/**`, `pages/**`, `app/**`
- Excludes backend paths

**Environments:**
- **Preview:** Automatic on PRs
- **Production:** Automatic on main branch

**Features:**
- Framework auto-detection (Next.js, React, Vue, Angular)
- Preview URLs on PRs
- Environment-specific variables

### 7. **deploy-vercel.yml** (UPDATED - Replaces both deploy-frontend.yml and deploy-backend.yml)
**Trigger:**
- Push to main 
- Pull requests
- Manual dispatch

**Purpose:** Deploy full-stack applications to Vercel (frontend + backend APIs)
**Features:**
- Handles both frontend and backend in one deployment
- Serverless functions for backend APIs
- Preview deployments for PRs
- Production deployment on main
- Framework auto-detection
- Environment variables management

### 8. **issue-reopen-handler.yml**
**Trigger:** 
- Issue reopened
- Issue comment with `/reopen` or "still broken" on closed issues

**Purpose:** Handle incomplete or broken issues that need additional work  
**Key Features:**
- Auto-labels reopened issues with `needs-fix`
- Detects if bug (`bug` label) or enhancement (`enhancement` label)
- Responds to `/reopen` commands in comments
- Permission checking (only author/collaborators can reopen)
- Provides clear next steps for reopened work

**Workflow for Incomplete Issues:**
1. Issue found to be incomplete/broken after closing
2. Original author or maintainer comments `/reopen` or reopens manually
3. Workflow adds `needs-fix` label plus `bug` or `enhancement`
4. Developer continues work with full context preserved
5. Creates new PR referencing the reopened issue

**Post-Merge Issue Discovery Workflow:**
When you discover problems AFTER merging a PR:

**Option 1: Same Issue Number (Reopen)**
```bash
# 1. Reopen the original issue
gh issue reopen [issue-number]

# 2. Start from fresh main branch (CRITICAL!)
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 3. Create new fix branch with -fix suffix
git checkout -b fix/[issue-number]-[description]-fix

# 4. Make fixes
# ... edit files ...

# 5. Create new PR referencing same issue
gh pr create --title "Fix: [Original Issue Title] (#[issue-number])" \
  --body "Fixes remaining issues in #[issue-number]"
```

**Option 2: New Issue for Follow-up**
```bash
# 1. Create new issue referencing the original
/create-issue "Follow-up: [Original Issue] - [Specific Problem]"
# In body: "Follow-up to #[original-issue-number]"

# 2. Follow normal workflow from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b fix/[new-issue-number]-follow-up

# 3. Complete fix and create PR for new issue
```

**NEVER:**
- ‚ùå Reuse the old merged branch
- ‚ùå Create commits on a closed PR's branch
- ‚ùå Force push to rewrite history
- ‚ùå Work from an outdated main branch

**ALWAYS:**
- ‚úÖ Start fresh from latest main
- ‚úÖ Create a new branch for fixes
- ‚úÖ Create a new PR (even for same issue)
- ‚úÖ Reference the original issue/PR

### 9. **pr-checklist-required.yml** (NEW)
**Trigger:** 
- Pull requests (opened, edited, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review)
- Pull request reviews
- Issue comments

**Purpose:** Enforce checkbox completion before PR merge
**Key Features:**
- Uses `mheap/require-checklist-action@v2`
- Blocks merge if any required checkboxes unchecked
- Allows optional checkboxes marked with "(optional)"
- Creates failing status check for branch protection
- **REQUIRES**: Branch protection rule with "Require All Checkboxes" as required check

### 10. **issue-checklist-enforcer.yml** (NEW)
**Trigger:**
- Issues (opened, edited, labeled)
- Issue comments

**Purpose:** Track checkbox progress in issues and auto-label
**Key Features:**
- Calculates completion percentage
- Adds progress comments showing status
- Auto-labels: `in-progress` (0-99%), `ready-for-pr` (100%)
- Visual progress indicators
- Only activates for issues with `ready-to-build` or `in-progress` labels

### 11. **block-pr-creation.yml** (NEW)
**Trigger:** Pull request opened

**Purpose:** Warn when creating PR with incomplete linked issues
**Key Features:**
- Checks all linked issues (Closes #123, Fixes #123)
- Counts unchecked boxes in linked issues
- Adds warning comment if tasks incomplete
- Adds `incomplete-issue` label as warning
- Doesn't block PR creation but provides visibility

### 12. **pr-checkbox-enforcer.yml.disabled** (ARCHIVED)
**Status:** Disabled - replaced by pr-checklist-required.yml
**Note:** Custom implementation kept for reference

### 13. **release.yml**
**Trigger:** Push of version tags (v*)

**Purpose:** Automatically create GitHub releases from tags  
**Key Features:**
- Generates release notes from commit history
- Detects pre-releases (tags with `-beta`, `-rc`, etc.)
- Closes related milestones automatically
- Creates GitHub release with changelog

**Version Strategy:**
- Tags trigger releases (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Milestones track features (e.g., "Authentication System")
- Multiple milestones can contribute to one release

## Checkbox Enforcement Flow (NEW)

### Complete Checkbox Lifecycle

1. **Issue Creation with Checkboxes**
   - User creates issue with task checkboxes
   - `issue-checklist-enforcer.yml` starts tracking progress
   - Issue gets labeled based on completion

2. **During Development**
   - Developer checks boxes as tasks complete
   - Progress comments auto-update (e.g., "4/7 tasks (57%)")
   - Labels change: `in-progress` ‚Üí `ready-for-pr` at 100%

3. **PR Creation**
   - Developer creates PR with its own checkboxes
   - `block-pr-creation.yml` warns if linked issue incomplete
   - `pr-checklist-required.yml` creates status check

4. **PR Review & Merge**
   - Reviewers can see checkbox status
   - **CANNOT MERGE** until all required boxes checked
   - Branch protection enforces "Require All Checkboxes"
   - Optional items (marked with "optional") don't block

### Setting Up Checkbox Enforcement

1. **Enable Branch Protection** (REQUIRED)
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule
   - Branch name pattern: main
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
   - Add check: "Require All Checkboxes"
   - ‚úÖ Include administrators (optional)
   ```

2. **Checkbox Format in Issues/PRs**
   ```markdown
   ## Required Tasks
   - [ ] Implementation complete
   - [ ] Tests written
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   
   ## Optional Tasks  
   - [ ] Performance optimization (optional)
   - [ ] Extra features (optional)
   ```

3. **Linking Issues to PRs**
   ```markdown
   Fixes #123
   Closes #456
   Resolves #789
   ```

## Complete Flow: Issue ‚Üí Production

### Step 1: Issue Creation
User creates issue ‚Üí 3 workflows trigger in parallel:
- `project-automation.yml` ‚Üí Adds to project board
- `auto-assign.yml` ‚Üí Assigns to creator
- `issue-to-implementation.yml` ‚Üí Creates branch

### Step 2: Development
Developer/Agent:
1. Checks out auto-created branch
2. Implements solution
3. Commits and pushes changes
4. Creates pull request

### Step 3: PR Testing & Review
PR created ‚Üí Workflows trigger:
- `ci-cd-pipeline.yml` ‚Üí Runs all quality gates
- `test-runner.yml` ‚Üí Runs project-specific tests
- `label-sync.yml` ‚Üí Validates and enforces allowed labels

### Step 4: Merge & Deploy
PR approved and merged ‚Üí After CI passes:
- `project-automation.yml` ‚Üí Updates issue status to "Done"
- `deploy-frontend.yml` ‚Üí Deploys to Vercel if frontend files changed
- `deploy-backend.yml` ‚Üí Deploys to DigitalOcean if backend files changed

## Getting Field IDs for Project Board

### 1. Get Project ID
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query {
    user(login: "YOUR_USERNAME") {
      projectV2(number: YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER) {
        id
      }
    }
  }'
```

### 2. Get Field IDs
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query {
    user(login: "YOUR_USERNAME") {
      projectV2(number: YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER) {
        fields(first: 20) {
          nodes {
            ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField {
              id
              name
              options {
                id
                name
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

### 3. Set Secrets
```bash
# Set PROJECT_TOKEN (use your personal access token)
gh secret set PROJECT_TOKEN

# Set field IDs
gh secret set PROJECT_ID --body "PVT_..."
gh secret set FIELD_STATUS_ID --body "PVTSSF_..."
gh secret set STATUS_TODO --body "option-id"
# ... etc
```

## Testing Workflows

### Test Issue Creation Flow
```bash
# Create test issue
gh issue create --title "[TEST] Feature request" \
  --body "Test issue for workflow validation" \
  --label "type:feature"

# Watch workflows
gh run list --limit 5

# Check project board
gh project view YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER --owner YOUR_USERNAME --web
```

### Test PR Flow
```bash
# Create test branch
git checkout -b test/workflow-validation

# Make changes and push
echo "test" > test.txt
git add . && git commit -m "Test workflows"
git push origin test/workflow-validation

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "Test PR" --body "Testing workflows"

# Monitor workflow runs
gh run watch
```

### Manual Workflow Trigger
```bash
# Trigger test runner
gh workflow run test-runner.yml

# Trigger deployment with specific environment
gh workflow run deploy-frontend.yml -f environment=preview
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Project Board Not Updating
**Error:** "Could not resolve to a ProjectV2"  
**Solution:** Ensure PROJECT_TOKEN has `project` scope and is from the project owner

#### 2. Multiple Workflow Runs
**Issue:** Same workflow firing multiple times  
**Solution:** Check for overlapping triggers in workflow files

#### 3. Deployment Failing
**Issue:** Environment variables not set  
**Solution:** Verify all required secrets are configured in repository settings

#### 4. Test Detection Failing
**Issue:** Tests not running automatically  
**Solution:** Ensure package.json has "test" script or appropriate test files exist

### Debug Commands

```bash
# View recent workflow runs
gh run list --limit 10

# View specific run details
gh run view RUN_ID

# View workflow logs
gh run view RUN_ID --log

# Re-run failed workflow
gh run rerun RUN_ID

# Check secret existence (not values)
gh secret list
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Workflow Design
- Keep workflows focused on single responsibilities
- Use path filters to prevent unnecessary runs
- Implement proper error handling and continue-on-error where appropriate

### 2. Security
- Never log sensitive information
- Use GitHub Secrets for all credentials
- Implement least-privilege principle for tokens

### 3. Performance
- Use caching for dependencies (node_modules, pip packages)
- Run jobs in parallel when possible
- Use matrix builds for multiple versions/platforms

### 4. Maintenance
- Document all required secrets
- Keep workflow files versioned and reviewed
- Test workflows in separate branches before merging

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Intelligent Priority Setting**: Claude Code analyzes issues and sets priority
2. **Auto-generated Test Cases**: AI creates tests based on implementation
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Automatic performance regression detection
4. **Dependency Updates**: Automated dependency PR creation
5. **Release Automation**: Semantic versioning and changelog generation

### Agent Integration Points
- Claude Code hooks for intelligent decision making
- GitHub Copilot for code suggestions
- Custom agents for specialized tasks

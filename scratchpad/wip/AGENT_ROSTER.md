**Examples of What Copilot Handles:**
- Fix typos and formatting
- Add simple comments
- Create basic validation
- Update configuration values
- Add single unit test
- Simple bug fixes

**Examples of What Agents Handle:**
- Any multi-file change
- Complex logic implementation
- Security-sensitive code
- Architecture decisions
- Performance optimization
- Integration with external services

## ðŸ”„ Agent Collaboration Matrix

| Primary Agent | Commonly Works With | For Tasks Like |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| frontend-tester | backend-tester | Full-stack features |
| frontend-tester | architect | Component design |
| backend-tester | security | API security |
| backend-tester | integrations | External services |
| security | ALL agents | Security validation |
| architect | refactor | System improvements |
| integrations | security | OAuth/auth flows |
| pr-reviewer | ALL agents | Final validation |

## ðŸ“Š Complexity Assignment Guide

| Complexity | Size | Examples | Who Handles |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | XS | Fix typo, add comment | Copilot |
| 2 | S | Simple validation | Copilot |
| 2 | M | Add form validation | Agent |
| 3 | M | Create API endpoint | Agent |
| 4 | L | Implement auth system | Multiple Agents |
| 5 | XL | Redesign architecture | All Agents + Human |

## ðŸš¨ Agent Escalation Paths

```yaml
Level 1: Single Agent
  â†’ Can handle independently
  
Level 2: Multi-Agent
  â†’ Coordinates with other agents
  â†’ Example: frontend + backend for full feature
  
Level 3: Security Block
  â†’ Security agent finds critical issue
  â†’ All work stops
  â†’ Human intervention required
  
Level 4: Human Required
  â†’ Major architecture changes
  â†’ Production security incidents
  â†’ Customer-facing critical paths
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Agent Selection

```bash
# The system automatically selects based on:
1. Issue labels
2. File changes in PR
3. Keywords in description
4. Complexity/Size matrix

# Manual override:
- Set agent in issue template
- Use 'assigned_agent' field
- Command: /assign-agent <name>
```

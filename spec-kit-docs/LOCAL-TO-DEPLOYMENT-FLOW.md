# Local Development to Deployment Flow

## The Complete Journey of a Feature

### Phase 1: Local Specification & Planning
All happens locally, no GitHub needed yet.

```bash
# 1. Define what you want to build
/specify Build a task management system with Kanban boards

# 2. Choose your tech stack
/plan Use Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind CSS

# 3. Generate implementation tasks
/tasks

# Creates: specs/001-feature-name/ with all plans and tasks
```

### Phase 2: Local Implementation
Still all local, Claude decides the order.

```bash
# 4. Start implementation
/implement

# Claude automatically:
# - Identifies infrastructure tasks (T001-T010)
# - Builds foundation first
# - Then tests (T011-T028)
# - Then core logic (T029-T037)
# - Finally features (T038+)
```

**What happens during /implement:**
1. Claude reads the tasks.md file
2. Uses TodoWrite to track progress
3. Executes tasks in proper order
4. May call AI CLIs for help:
   - `codex exec "create database schema"`
   - `gemini -p "generate test suite"`
   - `openai "design API structure"`

### Phase 3: Local Testing
Before any deployment, everything tested locally.

```bash
# Run tests locally
npm test
npm run e2e

# Start local development server
npm run dev

# Test in browser at localhost:3000
```

### Phase 4: Version Control (When Ready)
Only when feature is working locally.

```bash
# Initialize git if needed
git init
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete task management system"

# Create GitHub repo (if desired)
gh repo create my-project --private
git push -u origin main
```

### Phase 5: Deployment
Only after local development is complete.

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
/deploy

# What /deploy does:
# 1. Builds production bundle
# 2. Runs final tests
# 3. Pushes to Vercel
# 4. Returns deployment URL
```

## The Key Principle: Local First

```
Local Spec → Local Build → Local Test → Git (optional) → Deploy (when ready)
```

## What Each Tool Does

### Spec-Kit Commands (Local Planning)
- `/specify` - What to build (requirements)
- `/plan` - How to build (tech stack)
- `/tasks` - Steps to build (T001-T052)

### Our Commands (Local Execution)
- `/implement` - Execute the tasks
- `/test` - Run test suites
- `/deploy` - Ship to production

### AI CLIs (Decision Support)
- `codex` - Code implementation
- `gemini` - Documentation
- `openai` - Architecture decisions

## Example: Complete Feature Flow

```bash
# Monday: Planning
/specify Build a photo gallery with albums
/plan Use Next.js and Cloudinary
/tasks
# Result: specs/001-photo-gallery/ created

# Tuesday: Building
/implement
# Claude builds T001-T010 (infrastructure)
# Then T011-T028 (tests)
# Then T029+ (features)

# Wednesday: Testing
npm test
npm run dev
# Test locally at localhost:3000

# Thursday: Polish
# Fix any issues
# Add final touches

# Friday: Deploy
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Photo gallery complete"
/deploy
# Live at: https://my-app.vercel.app
```

## No GitHub Until Ready

**Local Development Advantages:**
- Faster iteration
- No CI/CD delays
- No PR overhead
- No deployment costs
- Complete focus on building

**When to Add GitHub:**
- Feature is working
- Ready for collaboration
- Need version history
- Want automated workflows

## The Beauty of This Approach

1. **Start Simple**: Just specify, plan, tasks, implement
2. **Stay Local**: No external dependencies
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Everything works before deployment
4. **Deploy Once**: When it's actually ready
5. **Add Complexity Later**: GitHub, CI/CD, etc. when needed

## Summary

```
Day 1: /specify → /plan → /tasks
Day 2-3: /implement (Claude handles the order)
Day 4: Local testing
Day 5: /deploy (when ready)
```

No GitHub needed until you want it. No deployments until it works. Just pure local development with AI assistance.

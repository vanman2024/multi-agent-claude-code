# Multi-Agent Template Analysis and Documentation Update

## Current Sprint: Modernize Documentation Based on Current Codebase

### Analysis Tasks
- [ ] T001 @gemini Analyze current project structure, project-sync system, and identify what's changed since docs were written
- [ ] T002 @gemini Review AI-DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md vs current reality - identify outdated sections and missing features
- [ ] T003 @gemini Evaluate README.md structure and suggest simplification/reorganization based on current capabilities

### Technical Assessment Tasks  
- [x] T010 @qwen Analyze the project-sync system performance and identify optimization opportunities ✅
- [x] T011 @qwen Review current DevOps/ops system integration and suggest improvements ✅
- [x] T012 @qwen Assess swarm deployment system efficiency and suggest refinements ✅

### User Experience Analysis
- [ ] T020 @codex Review README.md from new user perspective - identify confusing sections and suggest clearer structure
- [ ] T021 @codex Analyze the onboarding flow and suggest UX improvements for developers adopting the framework
- [ ] T022 @codex Evaluate documentation hierarchy and suggest better organization

### Integration & Recommendations
- [ ] T030 @claude Coordinate all findings and create prioritized list of documentation updates needed
- [ ] T031 @claude Provide specific recommendations for README simplification and AI-DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md updates
- [ ] T032 @claude Suggest workflow improvements based on current capabilities vs documented features

## Special Instructions for Agents

**DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES** - This is a READ-ONLY analysis task. Provide suggestions and recommendations only.

### Focus Areas:

**@gemini**: You have 2M context - analyze the ENTIRE codebase structure:
- Compare current project-sync capabilities vs what's documented
- Identify new features (like swarm deployment) that aren't properly documented
- Find obsolete documentation that no longer matches reality

**@qwen**: Focus on system performance and efficiency:
- How well does the current project-sync system work?
- Are there bottlenecks in the DevOps/ops workflow?
- Can the swarm deployment be optimized further?

**@codex**: Think like a new developer trying to use this framework:
- Is the README clear and actionable?
- What would confuse someone setting this up for the first time?
- How can we make the documentation more user-friendly?

**@claude**: Synthesize all findings into actionable recommendations:
- What are the top 5 documentation issues to fix?
- How should we restructure the README for clarity?
- What workflow updates are most critical?

## Expected Deliverables

Each agent should create a report file with their analysis and recommendations. Focus on:
1. What's working well
2. What's outdated or confusing  
3. What's missing from documentation
4. Specific suggestions for improvement
5. Priority ranking of changes needed

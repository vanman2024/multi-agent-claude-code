# RESET PLAN - Start Over with Manual Process

## The Problem
- 20+ workflows we don't understand
- 50+ documents that overlap
- Projects with auto-fields that fight with labels
- Slash commands built before we knew the workflow
- Can't see a simple issue → implementation → deploy cycle
- Everything automated before we proved it works manually

## The Solution: MANUAL EVERYTHING for 2 Weeks

### Week 1: Prove the Basic Cycle Works

**Day 1-3: One Simple Feature**
```bash
# 1. Create issue manually in GitHub UI
#    Title: "Add hello endpoint"
#    Description: "Create /api/hello that returns {message: 'Hello World'}"
#    Label: feature (manually add)
#    Milestone: None for now
#    Project: Don't add yet

# 2. Start work
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/80-hello-endpoint

# 3. Implement
# Make the change
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add hello endpoint"
git push -u origin feature/80-hello-endpoint

# 4. Create PR manually in GitHub UI
#    Title: "Implements #80: Add hello endpoint"
#    Body: "Closes #80"
#    
# 5. Merge PR
# Issue #80 auto-closes
# Delete branch

# 6. Deploy
git checkout main
git pull
vercel --prod
```

**What We Learn:**
- Does issue auto-close work? ✓
- Is the branch naming clear? ✓
- Do we need Projects yet? (Probably not)

**Day 4-7: Three More Features**
- Repeat the exact same process
- NO automation
- NO slash commands
- NO projects
- Just GitHub basics

### Week 2: Add ONE Thing at a Time

**Add Project Board (Manual)**
1. Create one Project board
2. Add ONLY these fields:
   - Status (Todo, In Progress, Review, Done)
   - Priority (High, Med, Low)
3. Manually move cards as you work
4. See if it adds value or just noise

**Add Milestones (Manual)**
1. Create "Week 3 Sprint"
2. Add 5 issues to it
3. See if milestone view helps or hurts

### What We DON'T Do Yet
- ❌ NO slash commands
- ❌ NO GitHub Actions (except PR close → issue close)
- ❌ NO auto-assignment
- ❌ NO auto-labeling
- ❌ NO Copilot assignment
- ❌ NO complex routing

## After 2 Weeks: Add Back ONLY What Hurt

**Pain Point → Solution**
- Creating issues is repetitive → Add `/create-issue` command
- Forgetting to pull → Add auto-pull to commands
- Can't track status → Add Project board
- Don't know what's in sprint → Add milestones

**But ONLY if we felt the pain!**

## The Nuclear Option: New Repo

If this is still too complex:
1. Create `vanman2024/simple-workflow-test`
2. ZERO workflows
3. ZERO automation
4. Just 5 labels
5. Prove the cycle works
6. Port lessons back here

## Success = Boring

After 2 weeks, we should be able to:
1. Create issue
2. Implement feature
3. Create PR
4. Merge
5. Deploy

That's it. No magic. No automation. Just GitHub basics.

THEN we can add automation to remove friction.

## The Key Insight

> We tried to build a Ferrari before learning to drive.
> Let's start with walking, then a bicycle, then maybe a car.

## Next Step

Pick ONE simple feature and do it 100% manually:
- No slash commands
- No automation
- No projects
- Just GitHub + git

Document exactly what you did.
That becomes our "real" workflow.
Everything else gets built to support THAT.

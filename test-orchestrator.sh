# Create detailed test instructions
cat << 'EOF' >> $TEST_RESULTS

## Manual Testing Instructions

### Setup Phase
```bash
# 1. Go to main repository (not worktree)
cd /home/gotime2022/Projects/multi-agent-claude-code

# 2. Ensure clean state
git status
# Should show: On branch main, nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### Test Scenario 1: Branch Enforcement
```bash
# Test from wrong branch (should FAIL)
git checkout 134-feature-unified-testing-strategy-for-frontend-and-backend
/work #126

# Expected: Error message about needing to be on main
# Expected: Instructions to run: git checkout main && git pull origin main
```

### Test Scenario 2: Auto-Pull Detection  
```bash
# Simulate being behind (optional - only if you want to test this)
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Go back one commit
/work #126

# Expected: Auto-pull message and successful pull
```

### Test Scenario 3: Worktree Prompt
```bash
# From feature branch
git checkout 134-feature-unified-testing-strategy-for-frontend-and-backend
/work #150  # Use different issue number

# Expected: Prompt with 3 options:
# 1. Create worktree (recommended)
# 2. Switch to main  
# 3. Cancel
```

### Test Scenario 4: Proper GitHub Branch Creation
```bash
# From main branch
git checkout main  
git pull origin main
/work #151  # Use new test issue

# Expected: 
# 1. Command runs gh issue develop #151 --checkout
# 2. Creates branch on GitHub first
# 3. Checks out locally
# 4. Shows branch name like: 151-feature-description
```

### Test Scenario 5: Issue Reference Setup
```bash
# After /work creates branch, check:
cat .gitmessage
# Expected: Should contain "Related to #151" or similar

git config --get commit.template
# Expected: Should show .gitmessage path
```

### Test Scenario 6: No Manual PR Creation
```bash
# During /work execution, watch output carefully
# Expected: NO "gh pr create" commands executed
# Expected: Message about automation handling PR creation
```

### Test Scenario 7: Intelligent Issue Selection  
```bash
# Test with no arguments
/work

# Expected: Analysis of available issues
# Expected: Explanation of WHY specific issue was selected
# Expected: Priority/blocker analysis
```

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Test Verification
- [ ] All implementation checks passed
- [ ] Test environment is clean  
- [ ] On main branch with latest changes

### Manual Test Execution
- [ ] Scenario 1: Branch enforcement (should fail from wrong branch)
- [ ] Scenario 2: Auto-pull detection (pulls latest changes)
- [ ] Scenario 3: Worktree prompts (offers 3 choices)
- [ ] Scenario 4: GitHub branch creation (uses gh issue develop)
- [ ] Scenario 5: Commit template setup (creates .gitmessage)
- [ ] Scenario 6: No manual PR creation (automation only)
- [ ] Scenario 7: Intelligent selection (analyzes and explains)

### Post-Test Validation  
- [ ] All commits reference issue numbers
- [ ] Branch appears in GitHub issue Development section
- [ ] No manual PRs were created
- [ ] Worktree functions correctly (if tested)
- [ ] Issue status updated correctly

## Test Execution Notes
(Add notes here during manual testing)

# Multi-Agent Development Workflow

## Our Three AI Agents

### 1. GitHub Copilot (Simple Tasks)
- **Handles**: Tasks with Complexity 1-2 AND Size XS/S
- **Auto-assigned**: Via MCP at issue creation
- **Creates**: Draft PRs automatically

### 2. Claude Code (Local) - You
- **Handles**: Complex tasks (Complexity 3+ OR Size M+)
- **Runs**: Architecture, security, complex features
- **Controls**: Overall system orchestration

### 3. Claude Code GitHub App (@claude)
- **Handles**: PR reviews, code implementation from issues
- **Triggered**: By @claude mentions in issues/PRs
- **Reviews**: All Copilot PRs automatically

## The Golden Rule: Size AND Complexity

**Copilot ONLY handles tasks that are BOTH:**
- **Simple** (Complexity 1-2 out of 5)
- **AND**
- **Small** (Size XS or S)

If either is higher → Claude Code handles it.

## Field Definitions

### Complexity (1-5 dropdown in GitHub Project)
- **1-2**: Simple, straightforward logic (Copilot eligible)
- **3**: Moderate complexity (Claude only)
- **4-5**: Complex, architectural decisions (Claude only)

### Size (XS/S/M/L/XL dropdown in GitHub Project)
- **XS**: < 1 hour (Copilot eligible)
- **S**: 1-2 hours (Copilot eligible)
- **M**: 2-4 hours (Claude only)
- **L**: 4-8 hours (Claude only)
- **XL**: > 8 hours (Claude only)

## Decision Matrix

| Complexity | Size | Who Handles It | Example |
|------------|------|---------------|----------|
| 1-2 | XS-S | **Copilot** | Fix typo, add endpoint, update test |
| 1-2 | M-XL | **Claude Code** | Large but simple refactor |
| 3-5 | Any | **Claude Code** | Design patterns, security, architecture |
| Any | L-XL | **Claude Code** | Multi-file changes, system redesign |

## How Assignment Works

### 1. Automatic Assignment (via /create-feature command)
```javascript
// This happens in .claude/commands/create-feature.md
const isSmallAndSimple = (complexity <= 2) && (size === 'XS' || size === 'S');

if (isSmallAndSimple) {
  await mcp__github__assign_copilot_to_issue({
    owner: "vanman2024",
    repo: "multi-agent-claude-code",
    issueNumber: issueNumber
  });
}
```

### 2. Manual Assignment (for existing issues)
```bash
# Check the issue's complexity and size first
gh issue view <number> --json projectItems

# Only assign if BOTH complexity ≤ 2 AND size ∈ {XS, S}
gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee copilot
```

## The Workflow

```
1. Issue Created (with Complexity & Size fields)
     ↓
2. Check: Complexity ≤ 2 AND Size ∈ {XS, S}?
     ↓ Yes              ↓ No
3. Assign to Copilot    Claude Code handles
     ↓
4. Agent Creates Draft PR
     ↓
5. PR Links Back to Issue
     ↓
6. Project Board Tracks Progress
```

## Critical Rules

### ✅ DO:
- Always create issues first
- Set Complexity and Size fields
- Use `mcp__github__assign_copilot_to_issue()` for assignment
- Let agents create PRs linked to issues
- Track everything in Project Board

### ❌ DON'T:
- Never use `create_pull_request_with_copilot()` directly
- Never have two agents on same issue
- Never assign Copilot to complex (3+) tasks
- Never assign Copilot to large (M+) tasks
- Never skip the issue creation step

## Examples

### Good for Copilot:
- "Fix typo in README" (Complexity: 1, Size: XS)
- "Add GET endpoint for user profile" (Complexity: 2, Size: S)
- "Update test assertion" (Complexity: 1, Size: XS)
- "Add logging to service" (Complexity: 2, Size: S)

### Must be Claude Code:
- "Design authentication system" (Complexity: 4, Size: L)
- "Refactor entire API layer" (Complexity: 2, Size: XL) ← Large!
- "Implement security middleware" (Complexity: 5, Size: M)
- "Create database schema" (Complexity: 3, Size: M)

## Monitoring

```bash
# See what Copilot is assigned to
gh issue list --assignee copilot

# See Copilot's PRs
gh pr list --author app/copilot

# Check project board
gh project item-list 1 --owner vanman2024
```

## If Things Go Wrong

### Issue missing Complexity or Size:
- Add them via GitHub Project UI
- Re-evaluate assignment

### Wrong agent assigned:
- Remove incorrect assignee
- Assign to correct agent
- Close any orphan PRs

### Duplicate work:
- Check assignees first
- One issue = one agent
- Close duplicate PR

### Workflow Approval Issues (Fixed):
**Problem**: Copilot PRs get stuck with "14 workflows awaiting approval" and checks showing "Expected — Waiting for status to be reported"

**Solution**: We have two automatic workflows that handle this:

1. **copilot-status-reporter.yml**: 
   - Immediately reports success for required checks on Copilot PRs
   - Prevents PRs from getting stuck waiting for approvals
   - Adds explanatory comment about auto-validation

2. **auto-approve-copilot-workflows.yml**:
   - Automatically approves pending workflow runs for Copilot
   - Handles deployment approvals if needed
   - Runs on `pull_request_target` to bypass restrictions

**How it works**:
- When Copilot creates a PR, GitHub treats it as a first-time contributor
- Our workflows detect Copilot PRs by checking:
  - User login: `copilot[bot]` or `github-copilot[bot]`
  - Branch prefix: `copilot/`
  - User type: `Bot`
- Required checks auto-pass with explanatory messages
- Human review is still required for code quality

# GitHub Labels Configuration
# This file defines the ONLY labels allowed in this repository
# DO NOT add labels manually - they will be removed by automation
# 
# Priority and Status are managed in GitHub Projects, not labels
# Keep labels minimal and focused on issue type only

# Type Labels (mutually exclusive - issue should have exactly ONE)

### @Symbol Task Assignment System

#### Check Current Assignments
```bash
# Check tasks assigned to @copilot
grep "@copilot" specs/*/tasks.md

# Find all implementation tasks
grep -i "implement\|create\|add\|build\|develop" specs/*/tasks.md | grep "@copilot"
```

#### Task Format Recognition
```markdown
- [ ] T010 @copilot Implement user authentication system
- [ ] T015 @copilot Build payment processing API
- [ ] T020 @copilot Create notification service
- [x] T025 @copilot Complete user management system ‚úÖ
```

#### Task Completion Protocol
1. **Implement the functionality** using Grok AI for speed
2. **Test basic functionality** works as expected
3. **Commit with proper message format**
4. **Mark task complete** with `[x]` and add ‚úÖ
5. **Hand off to specialists** if complexity increases

### Project Workflow

#### 1. Project Kickoff (Primary Role)
```bash
# Copilot initializes projects with spec-kit
copilot: /spec initialize new-project --framework next.js
copilot: /setup database schema design
copilot: /configure development environment
```

#### 2. Development Leadership

- **Collaboration**: Work with specialists for optimal results

#### Typical Workflow
```markdown
### Implementation Phase (copilot's strength)
- [ ] T010 @copilot Build user authentication system
- [ ] T011 @copilot Create payment processing API
- [ ] T012 @copilot Implement notification service

### Specialist Enhancement Phase
- [ ] T020 @codex Create frontend UI (depends on T010-T012)
- [ ] T021 @qwen Optimize performance (depends on T020)
- [ ] T022 @gemini Document system (depends on T021)
```

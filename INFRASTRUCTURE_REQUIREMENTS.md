## üìù Implementation Strategy

### Using GitHub Task Lists
1. Create one mega-issue with all checkboxes
2. Use GitHub's "Convert to issue" feature for major sections
3. This creates sub-issues that track back to the parent
4. Progress automatically updates in the parent issue

### Workflow:
1. Work through items systematically
2. Check off completed items in the mega-issue
3. Create sub-issues only for complex multi-day tasks
4. Close consolidated issues with reference to mega-issue

**Next Step**: Create single mega-issue #120 and close issues #91, #105, #108, #53 with reference.

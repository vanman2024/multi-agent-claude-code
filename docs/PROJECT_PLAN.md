# üéØ PROJECT PLAN: Taskify

## Executive Summary
Taskify is a team productivity platform that enables project management through intuitive Kanban boards. Teams can organize work visually, track progress in real-time, and collaborate through task assignments and comments. This initial phase focuses on core functionality with predefined users to validate the essential features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack (Recommended)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript (or Blazor if .NET preferred)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express (or .NET Core API)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Real-time**: WebSockets/SignalR for live updates
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Drag-Drop**: react-beautiful-dnd or native HTML5
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Vercel Functions (backend)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright

## üë• Target Users
**Initial Phase**: Internal testing with 5 predefined users
- 1 Product Manager: Strategic oversight and planning
- 4 Engineers: Task execution and technical implementation

**Future Phases**: 
- Small development teams (5-20 members)
- Agile teams needing visual task management
- Remote teams requiring async collaboration

## ‚ú® Core Features

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
1. **User Selection** (No Authentication)
   - Predefined 5 users (1 PM, 4 Engineers)
   - Simple user picker on launch
   - Session-based user context

2. **Project Management**
   - 3 sample projects pre-created
   - Project list view
   - Project selection to enter board

3. **Kanban Board**
   - 4 columns: To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done
   - Drag-and-drop task cards between columns
   - Visual highlighting of user's assigned tasks
   - Real-time updates when others make changes

4. **Task Management**
   - Create/edit task cards
   - Assign tasks to any of the 5 users
   - Update task status via drag-drop
   - Task details modal/sidebar

5. **Commenting System**
   - Unlimited comments per task
   - Edit own comments only
   - Delete own comments only
   - Comment timestamps and attribution

## üéØ Unique Value Proposition
- **Simplicity First**: No complex setup, just pick a user and start
- **Visual Clarity**: Instant visibility of your tasks vs others
- **Real-time Collaboration**: See changes as they happen
- **Permission Intelligence**: Smart comment permissions without complex ACLs

## üí∞ Business Model
**Phase 1**: Internal tool for validation
**Phase 2**: Freemium SaaS
- Free: Up to 5 users, 3 projects
- Pro: Unlimited users/projects, advanced features
- Enterprise: SSO, audit logs, priority support

- Automated deployments via Vercel
- Monitoring and error tracking
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Security & Compliance
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS and CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Secure session management
- CORS configuration

## üìù Detailed Requirements for Scaffolding

When passing to spec-kit, emphasize:

1. **Complete project structure** with all necessary folders
2. **Database setup** with migrations for Users, Projects, Tasks, Comments
3. **API scaffolding** for all CRUD operations
4. **Real-time infrastructure** for live updates
5. **Test infrastructure** from the start
6. **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions
7. **Docker setup** for local development
8. **Documentation structure** with README templates

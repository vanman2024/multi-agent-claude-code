# Feature Specification: Claude Code Hooks Integration System

## Feature Overview
**Name**: Complete Claude Code Hooks Integration
**Priority**: P3
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (3-5 days)
**Target Release**: Future Sprint

### Problem Statement
Currently, Claude Code hooks are configured but not functioning properly in the multi-agent framework. Developers face manual repetitive tasks, lack of context causing uninformed Claude decisions, and no coordination between multiple agents. This leads to inefficient workflows, missed pre-push validations, and disconnected agent operations.

### User Story
As a developer using the multi-agent framework
I want fully functional Claude Code hooks that automate my local workflow
So that I can focus on coding while hooks handle validation, context injection, and agent coordination

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have (P0)
- [ ] Fix existing hook configuration (matcher patterns) to enable execution
- [ ] Hooks visibly execute in transcript mode (Ctrl+R)
- [ ] test-before-push.sh prevents git push when tests fail
- [ ] auto-commit.sh creates commits on file changes
- [ ] current-work.sh injects GitHub issue context
- [ ] Clear documentation on hook setup and usage

### Should Have (P1)
- [ ] Agent coordination hooks for Task tool operations
- [ ] MCP server validation hooks for GitHub operations
- [ ] SessionStart hooks that load project context
- [ ] Hook execution logging for debugging
- [ ] Performance monitoring for hook operations

### Could Have (P2)
- [ ] Hook library with reusable patterns
- [ ] Visual hook status indicator in Claude Code
- [ ] Hook configuration validator tool
- [ ] Automatic hook installation script
- [ ] Hook metrics dashboard

## Technical Specification

### Frontend Components
- **Not Applicable**: This is a local development tooling feature
- **Configuration UI**: Future enhancement for visual hook management

### Backend Endpoints
- **Not Applicable**: Hooks run locally via Claude Code

        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### External Dependencies
- [ ] Claude Code CLI
- [ ] GitHub CLI (gh)
- [ ] jq for JSON processing
- [ ] Python for complex hooks
- [ ] Bash for simple hooks

## Hook Implementation Details

### Core Hooks to Implement

#### 1. test-before-push.sh (Fixed)
- Intercept Bash commands containing "git push"
- Run appropriate test suite based on project type
- Exit code 2 to block push on test failure

#### 2. auto-commit.sh
- Trigger on Edit|Write|MultiEdit operations
- Create atomic commits with descriptive messages
- Include file path and operation type

#### 3. current-work.sh
- Query GitHub for assigned issues
- Inject issue context into prompt
- Add recent PR status information

#### 4. load-context.sh (New)
- Run on SessionStart
- Load sprint goals and priorities
- Inject team conventions and patterns
- Add recent commit history

#### 5. log-agent-task.sh (New)
- Track Task tool invocations
- Log agent type and prompt
- Create audit trail of agent operations

#### 6. sync-agent-results.py (New)
- Capture SubagentStop results
- Update tracking system
- Coordinate multi-agent workflows

### Hook Communication Protocol
```python
# Input via stdin
{
  "session_id": "string",
  "transcript_path": "string",
  "hook_event_name": "string",
  "tool_name": "string",
  "tool_input": {},
  "tool_response": {}  # PostToolUse only
}

# Output via stdout/exit codes
# Exit 0: Success, stdout to transcript
# Exit 2: Block operation, stderr to Claude
# JSON output for advanced control
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Each hook script individually testable
- [ ] Mock Claude Code hook inputs
- [ ] Validate JSON parsing/output
- [ ] Test error handling paths

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full hook chain execution
- [ ] Claude Code integration verification
- [ ] Git operation interception
- [ ] Agent coordination flow

### E2E Tests
- [ ] Complete developer workflow simulation
- [ ] Multi-hook interaction scenarios
- [ ] Session persistence across restarts
- [ ] Performance under load

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
```env
CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/project  # Auto-set by Claude Code
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxx               # For GitHub operations
HOOKS_DEBUG=true                     # Enable debug logging
HOOKS_TIMEOUT=60                     # Hook execution timeout
```

### Migration Requirements
- [ ] Backup existing .claude/settings.json
- [ ] Update matcher patterns (Bash.*git push â†’ Bash)
- [ ] Make hook scripts executable
- [ ] Test in safe environment first

### Rollback Plan

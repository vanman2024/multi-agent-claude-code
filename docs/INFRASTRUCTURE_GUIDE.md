# Infrastructure Guide - How The Framework Works

## üèóÔ∏è The House Building Metaphor
This framework uses a house building metaphor to organize development work. Just like building a house, software has a natural order - you can't put up walls without a foundation, and you can't install electrical without framing. This guide explains how our infrastructure supports this systematic approach.

## üìã How The Infrastructure Components Work

### 1. PROJECT BOARD AUTOMATION ‚ùå
**Current State**: Not working properly
**Required State**: Automatic status transitions based on development events



#### Current Issues:
- Issue #91: Project automation not updating to In Progress on PR creation
- Copilot can move items but our automation cannot
- Reopened issues stay in "Done" column

---#### Requirements:
- [ ] When PR is created ‚Üí Move issue to "In Progress" column
- [ ] When PR marked ready ‚Üí Move to "In Review" column
- [ ] When PR merged ‚Üí Move to "Done" column
- [ ] When issue reopened ‚Üí Move back to appropriate column (not stuck in Done)
- [ ] Support backwards movement (Done ‚Üí In Progress for reopened issues)
- [ ] Sync with GitHub labels (status:in-progress, etc.)

### 2. LABEL AUTOMATION ‚ùå
**Current State**: Manual or missing
**Required State**: Automatic based on context

#### Requirements:
- [ ] Auto-apply type labels based on issue title prefix ([FEATURE], [BUG], etc.)
- [ ] Auto-apply priority labels based on metadata (P0, P1, P2, P3)
- [ ] Auto-apply size labels based on metadata (XS, S, M, L, XL)
- [ ] Auto-apply complexity labels based on metadata (1-5)
- [ ] Add status labels automatically (status:in-progress when work starts)
- [ ] Add sprint labels when added to sprint
- [ ] Remove conflicting labels (can't be both bug and feature)

---

### 3. MILESTONE USAGE ‚úÖ
**Current State**: Manual creation as needed
**Required State**: Feature/goal-based grouping

#### Proper Milestone Usage:
Milestones should group related issues by feature or goal, NOT by time periods.

**Good Examples:**
- "User Authentication" - all login/signup/password issues
- "Shopping Cart" - all cart-related features  
- "MVP" - everything needed for first release
- "Bug Fixes v1.1" - all bugs to fix after v1.0
- "Payment Integration" - all payment-related issues

**NOT for:**
- Sprint tracking (use project board columns instead)
- Time-based periods (Q1, Week 1, etc.)

**Implementation:**
- Teams create milestones manually for major features/releases
- Issues are assigned to milestones based on feature grouping
- No automation needed - keep it simple and flexible

---

### 4. ISSUE RELATIONSHIPS - The House Building Order ‚úÖ
**Current State**: Use GitHub's built-in mentions and task lists
**Required State**: Follow the house metaphor for natural dependencies

#### The House Building Order (Natural Dependencies):

**1. Foundation (Database & Data Layer)** üèóÔ∏è
- Must be built FIRST - everything depends on this
- Issues: Database schemas, tables, migrations
- Example: "Create users table", "Set up auth database"

**2. Plumbing (GitHub Automation & CI/CD)** üîß
- Carries things but doesn't think
- Issues: Workflows, deployments, pipelines
- Depends on: Foundation
- Example: "Set up deployment pipeline", "Create test workflow"

**3. Framing (Backend Services & APIs)** üè†
- The structural support
- Issues: API endpoints, services, business logic
- Depends on: Foundation (needs database)
- Example: "Create user API endpoint", "Build auth service"

**4. Electrical (Agent System & Intelligence)** ‚ö°
- Powers the smart features
- Issues: AI features, decision logic, agents
- Depends on: Framing (needs APIs to power)
- Example: "Add Copilot integration", "Create smart routing"

**5. Finishes (Frontend & UI)** üé®
- What users see and touch
- Issues: UI components, pages, styling
- Depends on: Framing & Electrical (needs APIs and features)
- Example: "Build login page", "Create dashboard UI"

#### How to Express Dependencies:

**In Issue Body:**
```markdown
**Layer**: Finishes (Frontend)
**Depends on**: #45 (User API endpoint), #23 (User table)
**Blocked by**: Need the foundation and framing first
```

**Using Task Lists:**
```markdown
### Prerequisites
- [ ] #23 User database table must be created first
- [ ] #45 User API endpoint must be working
- [ ] #67 Auth service must be deployed
```

**Simple Mentions:**
- "Blocked by #123"
- "Depends on #456"
- "Must complete #789 first"

#### Why This Works:
- **Natural order** - You can't build walls without foundation
- **Clear dependencies** - Everyone understands house building
- **No complex automation** - GitHub already tracks mentions
- **Flexible** - Use whatever notation makes sense

#### What NOT to Do:
- Don't build UI before APIs exist
- Don't create APIs before database tables
- Don't add AI features before basic functionality
- Don't overthink it - follow the house order

### 5. AGENT ASSIGNMENT AUTOMATION ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Current State**: Partially working

## üìù Implementation Strategy

### Using GitHub Task Lists
1. Create one mega-issue with all checkboxes
2. Use GitHub's "Convert to issue" feature for major sections
3. This creates sub-issues that track back to the parent
4. Progress automatically updates in the parent issue

### Workflow:
1. Work through items systematically
2. Check off completed items in the mega-issue
3. Create sub-issues only for complex multi-day tasks
4. Close consolidated issues with reference to mega-issue

**Next Step**: Create single mega-issue #120 and close issues #91, #105, #108, #53 with reference.

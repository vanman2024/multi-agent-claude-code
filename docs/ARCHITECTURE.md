# Architecture - Multi-Agent Development Framework

## System Design Overview
The Multi-Agent Development Framework is designed as a distributed system where GitHub serves as the central coordination hub, and various AI agents specialize in different development tasks.

## Core Architecture Patterns

### 1. Hub-and-Spoke Model
- **GitHub (Hub)**: Central data layer storing issues, PRs, discussions, and project state
- **Claude Code (Primary Orchestrator)**: Handles complex tasks and coordinates other agents
- **GitHub Copilot (Autonomous Agent)**: Handles simple, well-defined tasks
- **MCP Servers (Specialized Agents)**: Interface with external AI models for specific capabilities

### 2. Agent Assignment Strategy
```
Task Complexity & Size → Agent Assignment
├── Simple (≤2) & Small (≤S) → GitHub Copilot
├── Complex (>2) OR Large (>S) → Claude Code
└── Specialized (AI Models) → MCP Servers
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination Flow
```
1. Issue Creation → Automatic analysis & routing
2. Agent Assignment → Based on complexity/size rules
3. Task Execution → Agent-specific implementation
4. Progress Tracking → GitHub project boards
5. Quality Gates → Automated testing & review
```

## Component Architecture

### GitHub Integration Layer
- **GitHub API**: Full repository management via MCP server
- **Project Boards**: Automated task tracking and progress visualization
- **Issues & PRs**: Primary communication and coordination mechanism
- **Actions**: CI/CD automation and quality gates

### Agent Orchestration Layer
- **Claude Code CLI**: Primary orchestrator with full MCP tool access
- **Command System**: Slash commands for task delegation and management
- **Context Sharing**: PROJECT_CONTEXT.md and documentation synchronization
- **Fallback Chains**: local → free cloud → paid AI model progression

### MCP Server Architecture
```typescript
interface EnhancedMCPServer {
  // Context management
  readProjectContext(): Promise<ProjectContext>
  
  // File operations
  readSourceFile(filename: string): Promise<string>
  writeFile(filename: string, content: string): Promise<void>
  
  // AI-specific operations
  generateCode(task: string, context: ProjectContext): Promise<string>
  generateTests(sourceFile: string, context: ProjectContext): Promise<string>
  generateDocs(sourceFile: string, context: ProjectContext): Promise<string>
}
```

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **GitHub**: Central coordination and data layer
- **Claude Code CLI**: Primary agent orchestrator
- **MCP Protocol**: Agent communication standard
- **Markdown**: Documentation and specification format

### AI Model Integration
- **Together AI**: Complex code generation (3000 requests/month free)
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro**: Testing & documentation (1500 requests/day free)
- **HuggingFace**: Specialized models (30k characters/month free)
- **OpenAI**: Boilerplate generation (existing integration)

### Development Tools
- **GitHub CLI**: Repository management automation
- **Playwright**: Browser automation for frontend testing
- **Postman**: API testing and collection management
- **Node.js/Python**: MCP server implementation platform

## Deployment Architecture

### Local Development
- **Claude Code**: Runs locally with full MCP server access
- **MCP Servers**: Local stdio servers or HTTP endpoints
- **File System**: Direct access for reading/writing project files
- **Context Synchronization**: Automatic updates to PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

### Cloud Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows and quality gates
- **Vercel**: Deployment and hosting for web applications
- **External APIs**: Together AI, Gemini, HuggingFace integrations
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in usage tracking for free tier management

## Security Architecture

### API Key Management
- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage of API keys
- **Project-Level Scope**: Keys scoped to specific projects
- **Rotation Strategy**: Regular key rotation and audit
- **Minimal Permissions**: Least privilege access for each service

### File Access Security
- **Project Directory Restriction**: File access limited to project scope
- **Input Validation**: All file operations validated and sanitized
- **Audit Logging**: File operations tracked for security monitoring
- **Backup Strategy**: Automatic backups before file modifications

## Performance Architecture

### Response Time Targets
- **MCP Servers**: <500ms response time
- **File Operations**: <100ms for typical project files
- **API Calls**: <2s for external AI model requests
- **Context Loading**: <200ms for PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

### Scalability Considerations
- **Free Tier Management**: Usage tracking and rate limiting
- **Fallback Chains**: Automatic degradation to alternative models
- **Caching Strategy**: Context and file caching for performance
- **Concurrent Operations**: Safe multi-agent coordination

## Quality Architecture

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each MCP server component tested individually
- **Integration Tests**: File operations and API integrations
- **E2E Tests**: Complete workflow validation
- **Performance Tests**: Response time and throughput validation

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Usage Metrics**: API call tracking and rate limit monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Failure rates and error categorization
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and throughput monitoring
- **Agent Coordination**: Multi-agent interaction logging

## Design Decisions

### Why GitHub as Central Hub?
- **Industry Standard**: Developers already use GitHub for code management
- **Rich API**: Comprehensive API for automation and integration
- **Project Management**: Built-in project boards and issue tracking
- **Version Control**: Natural audit trail and change management

### Why MCP Protocol?
- **Standardization**: Industry-standard protocol for AI model integration
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new AI models and capabilities
- **Security**: Built-in authentication and authorization
- **Performance**: Efficient communication between agents

### Why Free Tier Focus?
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduces operational costs for users
- **Accessibility**: Lowers barrier to entry for framework adoption
- **Sustainability**: Ensures long-term viability of the framework
- **Performance**: Forces efficient usage patterns and optimization

This architecture enables a scalable, secure, and efficient multi-agent development system that leverages the best of both free and paid AI services while maintaining GitHub as the central coordination point.

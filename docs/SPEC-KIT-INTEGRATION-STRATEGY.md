# Spec-Kit + Multi-Agent Integration Strategy

## The Challenge
Spec-kit generates comprehensive specs from one prompt (52+ tasks), while our system prefers iterative refinement (10-20 issues). How do we bridge these approaches?

## Hybrid Workflow

### Option 1: Spec-Kit First (What You're Doing)
```bash
# 1. Use spec-kit for initial comprehensive generation
specify init
specify "build complete task management system"
# Generates 52 detailed tasks

# 2. Import into our system
/import-from-spec-kit
# Groups related tasks into 10-20 GitHub issues
# Each issue contains multiple spec-kit tasks

# 3. Use our agents to implement
/work #1
# Claude/Copilot follows spec-kit's detailed specs
```

### Option 2: Our System First (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Start with our discovery
/project-setup
# Create high-level vision (PROJECT_PLAN.md)

# 2. Generate targeted specs
specify "authentication system"  # Just auth
specify "task management"       # Just tasks
# Smaller, focused generations

# 3. Implement iteratively
/create-issue "Authentication" --from-spec
/work #1
```

### Option 3: Progressive Enhancement
```bash
# 1. Basic scaffold with spec-kit
specify init --minimal
# Creates structure, not full specs

# 2. Add features progressively
/create-issue "Add user authentication"
# When working, generate spec on-demand:
specify "user authentication with JWT"

# 3. Specs generated as needed
# Not everything upfront
```

## Key Integration Points

### 1. Task Grouping
When spec-kit generates 52 tasks, we should:
- Group related tasks into features
- Create 1 GitHub issue per feature
- Reference spec-kit task IDs in issue

Example:
```markdown
## Issue #1: Authentication System
Implements spec-kit tasks: #1-8
- [ ] Task #1: Create user model
- [ ] Task #2: JWT implementation
...
```

### 2. Spec-to-Issue Converter
Create `/import-from-spec-kit` command that:
```javascript
// Reads all .specify/features/*.md files
// Groups by feature area
// Creates GitHub issues with:
{
  title: "Feature: Authentication",
  body: "Implements spec-kit tasks #1-8\n[Details from specs]",
  labels: ["feature", "spec-kit-generated"],
  complexity: 3,  // Based on task count
  size: "L"       // Based on scope
}
```

### 3. Dynamic Spec Generation
Instead of generating everything upfront:
```bash
# In /work command
if (issue.needs_spec && !spec_exists) {
  // Generate spec on-demand
  specify(issue.title)
}
```

### 4. Spec Updates on the Fly
What you mentioned about adjusting:
```bash
# When requirements change mid-development
/update-spec #1 "add OAuth support"
# Regenerates just that spec section

# Our agents detect spec changes
/work #1 --refresh-spec
# Re-reads spec and adjusts implementation
```

## The Bridge Commands

### `/import-from-spec-kit`
- Reads `.specify/` directory
- Groups tasks into features
- Creates GitHub issues
- Maps spec tasks to issue checkboxes

### `/spec-generate [feature]`
- Generates spec for single feature
- More granular than full system
- Can be called during /work

### `/spec-update [task-id]`
- Updates specific spec section
- Triggers re-evaluation in active work
- Maintains consistency

## Recommended Workflow

For your current situation with 52 tasks:

1. **Group the tasks** by feature area:
   ```bash
   Authentication (tasks 1-8)
   Task Management (tasks 9-20)
   Projects (tasks 21-30)
   ...
   ```

2. **Create meta-issues**:
   ```bash
   /create-issue "Epic: Authentication System"
   /create-issue "Epic: Task Management"
   ```

3. **Link specs to issues**:
   - Each issue references its spec-kit tasks
   - Implementation follows the specs
   - Adjustments update both spec and implementation

4. **Work iteratively**:
   ```bash
   /work #1  # Works through all auth tasks
   ```

## Benefits of Hybrid Approach

1. **Best of Both Worlds**
   - Spec-kit's comprehensive planning
   - Our iterative, adaptive execution

2. **Flexibility**
   - Can generate all specs upfront OR on-demand
   - Can update specs during development
   - Can work with partial specs

3. **Traceability**
   - Every implementation traces to a spec
   - Every spec maps to GitHub issues
   - Complete audit trail

4. **Efficiency**
   - Don't over-specify features that might change
   - Generate detailed specs only when ready to build
   - Adjust specs based on learnings

## Next Steps

1. Create `/import-from-spec-kit` command
2. Add spec-kit task grouping logic
3. Integrate spec generation into `/work` flow
4. Add spec update detection to agents

This way, spec-kit becomes our "specification engine" while our multi-agent system remains the "execution engine" - they complement rather than compete.

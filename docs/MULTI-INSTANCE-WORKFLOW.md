# Multi-Instance Claude Code Workflow Guide

## The Core Problem

Building large applications with a single Claude instance is **slow**. But using multiple instances with worktrees creates **chaos** - lost code, merge conflicts, confusion about which version is running.

This guide provides strategies to safely use multiple Claude instances for faster development.

## Strategy Overview

### üéØ The Golden Rule
**Separate by concern, not by convenience**

Multiple instances work well when they're working on COMPLETELY separate areas. They fail when there's ANY overlap.

## Safe Multi-Instance Patterns

### Pattern 1: Vertical Slice (AVOID for multi-instance)
‚ùå **DON'T DO THIS with multiple instances:**
- Instance 1: Backend API for user auth
- Instance 2: Frontend UI for user auth
- **Problem**: These are tightly coupled - can't test one without the other

### Pattern 2: Horizontal Separation (SAFE)
‚úÖ **DO THIS instead:**
- Instance 1: Complete user authentication (backend + frontend)
- Instance 2: Complete reporting system (backend + frontend)
- **Why it works**: No overlap, each instance owns their full feature

### Pattern 3: Layer Separation (SAFE with rules)
‚úÖ **Can work if strictly enforced:**
- Instance 1: Database migrations and models only
- Instance 2: API endpoints only (after Instance 1 completes)
- Instance 3: Frontend only (after Instance 2 completes)
- **Requirements**: Sequential work, clear handoffs

## Workflow Decision Tree

```
Is the feature backend + frontend coupled?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use single instance on main branch
‚îÇ        (Most features fall here)
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Can features overlap?
    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use single instance on main branch
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Are you building foundation (DB/models)?
        ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use single instance first, then split
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Safe to use multiple instances
```

## Practical Workflows

### Workflow A: Single Instance (Safest, Slower)
**When to use**: Frontend-heavy features, tightly coupled features, uncertain scope

```bash
# One Claude instance, main branch
git checkout main
git pull
/work #123
# Implement feature completely
# Test everything together
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: Complete feature"
git push
```

**Pros**: No conflicts, no confusion, everything works together
**Cons**: Slower development

### Workflow B: Multiple Instances - Separate Features
**When to use**: Building multiple independent features simultaneously

```bash
# Instance 1: Authentication system
git checkout -b feature/auth
/work #101  # Complete auth system

# Instance 2: Reporting system (different terminal)
git checkout -b feature/reports  
/work #102  # Complete reporting system

# Both can work simultaneously without conflicts
```

**Pros**: 2x faster development
**Cons**: Need careful planning to ensure no overlap

### Workflow C: Multiple Instances - Same Feature (DANGEROUS)
**When to use**: Only with VERY careful coordination

```bash
# Instance 1: Backend API
git worktree add ../worktrees/api-backend feature/api
cd ../worktrees/api-backend
# Work on ONLY backend files

# Instance 2: Frontend UI
git worktree add ../worktrees/ui-frontend feature/ui
cd ../worktrees/ui-frontend  
# Work on ONLY frontend files

# CRITICAL: Define exact file boundaries
# Backend: /api/*, /models/*, /services/*
# Frontend: /components/*, /pages/*, /styles/*
```

**Pros**: Parallel development on same feature
**Cons**: High risk of conflicts, ports issues, confusion

## Port Management for Multiple Instances

### Reserved Port Assignments
```
8080 - Main branch (production-like)
8081 - Worktree/Feature 1
8082 - Worktree/Feature 2
8083 - Worktree/Feature 3
3000 - Frontend dev server (main)
3001 - Frontend dev server (feature 1)
3002 - Frontend dev server (feature 2)
```

### Automatic Port Selection
```javascript
// In server.js
const BASE_PORT = 8080;
const BRANCH = process.env.GIT_BRANCH || 'main';
const PORT = BRANCH === 'main' ? BASE_PORT : BASE_PORT + hashCode(BRANCH) % 20;
```

## Critical Rules for Multi-Instance Success

### 1. File Ownership Rules
- Each instance must have EXCLUSIVE ownership of their files
- Never have two instances editing the same file
- Document ownership in each issue

### 2. Merge Frequency Rules  
- Merge at least every 4 hours
- Never let branches diverge more than 10 commits
- Always pull before starting work

### 3. Communication Rules
- Document which instance is doing what
- Use issue comments to coordinate
- Clear handoff points between instances

### 4. Testing Rules
- Each instance tests their own work
- Integration testing after EVERY merge
- Never merge untested code

## When to STOP Using Multiple Instances

STOP if you see:
- Frequent merge conflicts
- "Lost" code that was working before  
- Confusion about which version is running
- More time managing instances than coding
- Features breaking after merges

## Recommended Approach for Large Apps

### Phase 1: Foundation (Single Instance)
- Database schema
- Core models
- Authentication
- Basic routing

### Phase 2: Parallel Development (Multiple Instances)
- Instance 1: Admin dashboard
- Instance 2: User dashboard  
- Instance 3: API endpoints
- Instance 4: Background jobs

### Phase 3: Integration (Single Instance)
- Merge all branches
- Integration testing
- Bug fixes
- Polish

## Quick Reference Commands

### Check what's running where
```bash
# See all worktrees
git worktree list

# See what's on each port
lsof -i :8080-8090

# See all branches
git branch -a

# See divergence from main
git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main
```

### Safe worktree creation
```bash
# ALWAYS do this sequence
gh issue develop 123 --checkout
cd /path/to/worktree
git fetch origin main
git merge origin main  # GET LATEST CODE!
```

### Emergency cleanup
```bash
# If everything is broken
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git worktree prune
killall node  # Stop all servers
# Start fresh
```

## The Bottom Line

**For speed**: Use multiple instances on completely separate features
**For safety**: Use single instance on main branch
**For sanity**: Document everything, merge often, test always

The fastest workflow that still works is better than the perfect workflow that creates chaos.

# Framework Implementation Checklist

## What We Have vs What We Need

### ✅ What's Already Working:
1. **GitHub Workflows**
   - CI/CD pipeline (testing, quality checks)
   - Deployment workflows (frontend/backend)
   - Project board automation
   - Label management
   - Issue to implementation

2. **Documentation**
   - Multi-Agent Framework design
   - Project setup process
   - Templates for issues/features

3. **MCP Servers**
   - Supabase configured
   - GitHub configured
   - Postman configured

### ❌ What's Missing for Complete Workflow:

## 1. SLASH COMMANDS NEEDED

### Core Commands (Priority 1):
```markdown
/project-setup     ✅ Documented, needs implementation
/feature-create    ❌ Create feature issue with proper labels
/feature-build     ❌ Start building a feature (assigns agent)
/test             ❌ Run tests locally or in CI
/deploy           ❌ Deploy to staging/production
```

### Infrastructure Commands (Priority 2):
```markdown
/infra-setup      ❌ Create all infrastructure issues
/db-setup         ❌ Set up Supabase schema
/api-setup        ❌ Set up DigitalOcean functions
```

### Utility Commands (Priority 3):
```markdown
/status           ❌ Check project/issue status
/pr-create        ❌ Create PR from current branch
/webhook-test     ❌ Test webhooks via DigitalOcean
```

## 2. GITHUB WORKFLOWS NEEDED

### Missing Critical Workflows:
```yaml
project-initialization.yml   ❌ Creates infra issues on new project
pr-automation.yml           ❌ Auto-creates draft PR on issue creation
infrastructure-check.yml    ❌ Blocks features until infra complete
```

### Workflow Enhancements Needed:
- `issue-to-implementation.yml` needs:
  - ❌ Auto draft PR creation
  - ❌ Check for blocking issues
  - ❌ Agent assignment logic

## 3. AGENT SYSTEM (Can Wait)

For now, we can work WITHOUT agents by:
- Using Claude Code directly
- Manual development
- Focus on workflow automation first

## 4. COMPLETE END-TO-END FLOW

### What Should Happen:

#### A. Project Setup (Day 1)
```bash
# Clone framework
git clone vanman2024/multi-agent-claude-code my-api-connector
cd my-api-connector
rm -rf .git && git init

# Run setup
claude /project-setup
# → Creates ARCHITECTURE.md
# → Creates INFRASTRUCTURE.md
# → Creates infrastructure issues (blocking)
```

#### B. Infrastructure Build (Day 2-3)
```bash
# Work through infrastructure issues
claude /db-setup        # Sets up Supabase schema
claude /api-setup       # Sets up DigitalOcean functions
# Each closes an infrastructure issue
```

#### C. Feature Development (Day 4+)
```bash
# Create feature
claude /feature-create "User authentication"
# → Creates issue
# → Creates branch
# → Creates draft PR immediately

# Build feature
claude /feature-build
# → Checks no blocking issues
# → Starts development
# → Updates PR as we go

# Test
claude /test
# → Runs tests locally
# → Updates PR status

# Deploy
claude /deploy staging
# → Deploys to DigitalOcean
# → No ngrok needed!
```

## 5. IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Phase 1: Core Commands (THIS WEEK)
1. [ ] Implement `/project-setup` command
2. [ ] Implement `/feature-create` command
3. [ ] Implement `/feature-build` command
4. [ ] Implement `/test` command
5. [ ] Implement `/deploy` command

### Phase 2: Workflow Automation (THIS WEEK)
1. [ ] Create `project-initialization.yml`
2. [ ] Create `pr-automation.yml`
3. [ ] Enhance `issue-to-implementation.yml`
4. [ ] Add blocking issue checks

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Commands (NEXT WEEK)
1. [ ] Implement `/infra-setup` command
2. [ ] Implement `/db-setup` command
3. [ ] Implement `/api-setup` command

### Phase 4: Testing (NEXT WEEK)
1. [ ] Clone framework to new repo
2. [ ] Run through complete flow
3. [ ] Fix any issues
4. [ ] Document learnings

## 6. DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY (NO NGROK!)

### All Testing via DigitalOcean:
```bash
# Deploy webhook handler
doctl serverless deploy

# Get public URL
doctl serverless functions get webhook --url
# → https://faas-nyc1-xxxxx.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-xxxxx/default/webhook

# Update external system with DO URL
# Test directly against DigitalOcean
```

### Why This Works:
- DigitalOcean Functions are instant
- Public URLs immediately available
- No tunnel needed
- Logs available via: `doctl serverless activations logs`

## 7. SUCCESS CRITERIA

We can consider the framework "complete" when:
1. ✅ Can clone and setup a new project in < 10 minutes
2. ✅ Infrastructure issues block feature development
3. ✅ Features auto-create draft PRs
4. ✅ Tests run automatically
5. ✅ Deployment works to DigitalOcean
6. ✅ Complete flow works without manual GitHub UI

## 8. WHAT WE DON'T NEED YET

These can wait:
- ❌ Full agent system (use Claude Code directly)
- ❌ Complex hooks (basic automation is enough)
- ❌ Multiple deployment environments (start with staging)
- ❌ Advanced monitoring (DO has basic monitoring)

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Start with slash commands** - These drive everything
2. **Fix the workflows** - Make automation work
3. **Test with real project** - Clone and try it
4. **Iterate based on pain points**

The goal: By end of this week, we should be able to clone this framework and build a real API integration project!

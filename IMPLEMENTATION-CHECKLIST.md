# Implementation Checklist - Multi-Agent Development Framework

## Core Framework Components

### 1. GitHub Project Board Setup ✅
- [x] Complexity field (1-5 dropdown)
- [x] Size field (XS/S/M/L/XL dropdown)
- [x] Status workflow (Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done)
- [x] Milestone tracking
- [x] Component tagging

### 2. Agent Assignment System ✅
- [x] Complexity + Size based routing
- [x] Copilot handles: Complexity ≤ 2 AND Size ∈ {XS, S}
- [x] Claude handles: Everything else
- [x] MCP tool integration for assignment
- [x] No overlap policy enforced

### 3. GitHub Workflows ✅
- [x] CI Testing Pipeline (quality gates)
- [x] Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
- [x] Backend Deployment (DigitalOcean)
- [x] PR Automation (draft PR creation)
- [x] Infrastructure blocking checks
- [x] Label enforcement (8 labels only)

### 4. Slash Commands ✅
- [x] `/create-feature` - Creates issue with auto-assignment
- [x] `/deploy` - Deploys to staging/production
- [x] `/test` - Runs test suite
- [x] `/setup-project` - Initializes cloned repo

### 5. MCP Server Integrations ✅
- [x] GitHub MCP - Issue/PR management
- [x] Supabase MCP - Database operations
- [x] Playwright MCP - Browser automation
- [x] Filesystem MCP - File operations

## Deployment Infrastructure

### 1. Supabase (Database) 
- [ ] Project created
- [ ] Schema deployed
- [ ] Auth configured
- [ ] Edge functions ready
- [ ] Row-level security enabled

### 2. Vercel (Frontend)
- [ ] Project linked
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Custom domain configured
- [ ] Preview deployments enabled

### 3. DigitalOcean (Backend)
- [ ] Functions deployed
- [ ] Webhook endpoints configured
- [ ] API routes established
- [ ] Secrets configured

### 4. GitHub Configuration
- [ ] Repository secrets set
- [ ] Project board created
- [ ] Webhooks configured
- [ ] Branch protection rules

## Project Cloning Process

### When Cloning This Framework:

1. **Initial Setup**
```bash
git clone [this-repo] [new-project-name]
cd [new-project-name]
claude /setup-project
```

2. **Infrastructure Creation**
- [ ] Creates Supabase project
- [ ] Links Vercel project
- [ ] Deploys DigitalOcean functions
- [ ] Sets up GitHub project board
- [ ] Configures all secrets

3. **Verification**
- [ ] Test agent assignment
- [ ] Test deployment pipeline
- [ ] Test webhook integration
- [ ] Test MCP connections

## Ready-to-Use Checklist

### Before First Feature:
- [ ] All MCP servers authenticated
- [ ] Project board has Complexity/Size fields
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines tested
- [ ] Deployment targets configured
- [ ] Agent assignment rules verified

### For Each Feature:
1. [ ] Create issue with `/create-feature`
2. [ ] Verify agent assignment (Copilot or Claude)
3. [ ] Monitor draft PR creation
4. [ ] Review and merge PR
5. [ ] Verify deployment

## Success Indicators

✅ **Framework is ready when:**
- Issues auto-assign based on complexity/size
- PRs automatically created and linked
- Deployments trigger on merge
- Project board updates automatically
- No manual intervention needed for standard workflows

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test agent assignment
claude /create-feature --complexity 1 --size XS --title "Test Copilot"
claude /create-feature --complexity 4 --size L --title "Test Claude"

# Test deployment
claude /deploy --env staging

# Check project status
gh project item-list 1 --owner vanman2024

# Monitor Copilot
gh issue list --assignee copilot
gh pr list --author app/copilot
```
